Welcome back. I hope Winter break treated you kindly. I finished a couple of novels, ate too much pie and went on multiple long walks. I received several pairs of wool socks for Christmas and indulged in my new favorite Bitterman Holiday traditionhomemade porchetta on Boxing Day. All in all it was a successful fortnight.Now that January has returned with much cooler temperatures (is that a snowflake I see in the forecast?), things should begin to return to normal. As school starts anew, the days of the week take on meaning again; there is no such thing as a Monday over winter break. The daylight hours will slowly elongate, and sleep will once again become a valuable commodity. This is the rhythm of academic life, a pattern I have followed ever since that first day of school in Ms. Sally Harpers class at Merrick-Moore Elementary in 1971. I enjoy the freedom that breaks afford, but I start to miss the patterns of work, the regular hours, the routines, the writing of Yo La TengoI hope Wednesday finds you refreshed and ready to hit the ground running. Those alarm clocks will sound awfully early in the morning. Embrace these last days before it all comes to an end, then sharpen your pencils, don that new sweater your grandma gave you and arrive at school with a purpose. We will have Morning Meeting! on Wednesday, an Advisory! on Thursday and a junior class meeting on Friday. There are only eleven days left in the semester (the official end of first semester is Friday (1/19)), so plenty of time to bolster that first semester average. Lets embrace 2018 and all the promise it holds.Heres to a successful and happy new year. In the final words of the 12th DoctorLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Another week finds us facing a scary world with questions that tend to outnumber answers. Wednesdays attack on the Capitol was shocking on so many levels, and the current pace of the pandemic is a bleak reminder that winter is now here. The world seems filled with chaos and uncertainty. In these moments, we rely on our mutual support more than any other time to allow us to share our fears and concerns, to help us process the confusion, and, most importantly, to help us realize that we are not in this alone. As our Head of School shared on Wednesday:Tomorrow and throughout the spring  as we navigate this threat to the democratic process, along with the national racial reckoning and the COVID-19 pandemic  we will need to find strength in each other and in our global, national, local and school communities. My conversation with the students in my Ethics class on Thursday was an important step personally in finding the strength that we all need to face the challenges ahead. Hearing my class of seniors share their thoughts about Wednesday, and seeing in them the empathy and intelligence that is the promise of our future, makes me hopeful. And hope can be an invaluable commodity when we are confronted with chaos. I have faith that we as a community will rise to the occasion and meet the myriad challenges ahead with compassion and understanding and love.As we return to campus this week to carry on this vital work, we must do so safely. As Mr. Ulku-Steiner shared with me earlier this morning:We cannot, and will not, relax with our protective protocols.Thus, as we plan our return to school this week, it remains vitally important that we renew our commitment to safety on campus. We have been both diligent and fortunate this year with our efforts to prevent transmission at DA, and we remain dedicated to keeping our campus open while keeping everyone as safe as possible. To that end, please take a moment to review our prevention and protection protocols in our COVID-19 Addendum to All-School Handbook.Most importantly:Please keep your student home if they are exhibiting signs or have symptoms of illness.This seems obvious, but it remains our first and best line of defense against transmission. As part of our commitment to a safe return to campus please take note of the following:Lunch protocols:We know that removing our masks to eat is when we are most vulnerable, so we will continue to eat outside when weather permits. Above 40 and sunny is our basic rule of thumb here, and the week ahead looks promising for outdoor dining. When we are forced to inside, we are using our STEM labs, our large rooms in Hock and our large gathering spaces like Assembly Hall or Kenan lobby (or the Learning Commons for seniors). When we must eat lunch inside we ask our advisors to follow these guidelines:Everyone will wash their hands both before and after lunch (we do this when eating outside as well)Everyone will be spaced appropriately to allow a minimum of 6 feet between studentsTalking will be limited while our masks are off and we are eatingWe will wear our masks once we finish eatingTravel reminder:I sent an email yesterday dedicated to this issue, but it bears repeating.From Michael Ulku-Steiners email on 18 December 2020:If you choose to travel over the holiday season, please keep your student(s) home for 10 days after your return. Students may also return to campus after 7 days with a negative result of a PCR test administered 5 days after returning home.This policy includes any travel between 12/18/20 and 1/10/21.If you travelled during this window, please calculate the date of your students return to campus and contact your childs advisor with that information.Advisors will then inform teachers and Verle Regnerus so we can know which students will remain remote next week.Communication:Also, per theDA Community Health Compact, you will need to report any positive cases within your family.If you or anyone in your household receives a positive test,please contact Gem Gates immediatelyathealth@da.orgor (919) 489-3400 ext. 6513.It is beneficial for the whole community when families are transparent and prompt in communicating with Gem, who is conscientious about privacy and adept at guiding families through COVID protocols.Support:Many of you have asked about ways to support faculty and the school. The best way to help right now is to volunteer to assist with our morning temperature checks. Please go to our Sign-Up Genius page to lend your support. Volunteers are sorely needed.Thank you for supporting these efforts to keep our campus safe. The 20202021 school year continues to require patience, flexibility, understanding and collaboration as we reassert our commitment to academic excellence under circumstances that are difficult to predict.As always, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you have been able to appreciate the warm weather this weekend. Last nights rain could not put a damper on our In the Pocket (alumni and family) concert. It was an alumni studded event (15 graduates returned for the show) and Kenan was definitely rocking. If you couldnt make the show, head over to the ITP Facebook page and checkout the video. Be prepared for some extreme closeups of Mr. Meyer at the start, but the show commences in earnest around the 25 minute mark. If you want to smile and tap your foot and celebrate the DA family, this is the show to watch. Congrats to everyone involved, faculty, students, family and alums. This was another great performance, and I am looking forward to the ITP album dropping soon.I also hope you are ready for the last week of the semester. We will be back into our regular routine for the week. Morning Meeting on Monday, Advisory on Tuesday and another drill on Wednesday. As is typically the case, we will have Extended Tutorials Wednesday through Friday to afford everyone the space necessary to complete all the work for first semester. Use that time for a little extra studying or a quick check in with your teachers to make sure everything has been turned in and you have completed all of your assignments for the first half of the year.Best of luck this week. Im off to yoga again, just keeping up with those New Years resolutions. Another of my resolutions (make more biscuits) resulted in some inedible pucks yesterday that, while they showed a lot of potential, did not quite qualify as food. Biscuit lesson number one: self-rising and plain flour are very different; one needs to read recipes carefully. Nevertheless, I have a year to perfect my biscuits, and, as my daughter put it, I have nowhere to go but up. Best of luck this week, remember, even if your biscuits fail, you can still Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope last week was a welcome return to learning. Coming back from an extended break can be a bit jolting; it certainly appeared that way in my AP Psychology class last Monday at 8:15 am. Changing gears to accommodate school mode can require some internal adjustments, but after a full week of classes we should all be ready to engage wholly in the important work that is education. I greatly enjoyed the time with family, but I also greatly enjoyed my return to my other family: the students and colleagues that enrich my life daily. I so enjoy the work I do, teaching, administrating, interacting and learning. Each morning is full of promise, and though some days can seem long, I sleep well at night after putting in a day of service and learning.As part of your return to DA last week, you most likely noticed that there have been some significant transformations to the Humanities wing. Windows and doors have replaced plywood, sheetrock and now paint have transformed open spaces into rooms, and imagined classrooms are starting to look like their real world counter parts. Yes, while we travelled and celebrated and relaxed, construction continued apace, and we are on schedule to transition to our new English and History classrooms sometime in late April or early May. If you have not done so already, take a peek in those windows opposite your Maths and Science classes to see these marvelous new spaces. The new Commons with its staircase and seating and high windows will be a beautiful space for class meetings and studying between classes. The view from the second floor English classrooms offers a beautiful vista from which to appreciate our campus. I grow more and more excited about this final addition to our academic space. While this year has been filled with inconvenience, the final product will be worth all the bother. By years end, we will be offering all of our core academic classes in new spaces. Our STEM classes made the first move in August, Foreign Languages followed in November with their move to Hock, and the Humanities are preparing for their big move in the coming months. Such transformations can be difficult; they require patience and flexibility and a readiness to embrace change. The upper school is in the midst of some truly significant alterations, but as the finished product starts to assume its final shape, inconvenience wanes in the face of anticipation. Take a moment this week to gaze in those windows and imagine your future self: older, wiser and appreciating a new space and a new perspective.The week ahead is your last chance to finish the semester like a champ. Like Cam Reddish on Saturday, embrace the role of difference maker. You have been preparing for this moment all year. Perhaps you have struggled to date, but you have been putting in the hard work to ready yourself for this final week. Now is the time to seal the deal and show everyone that you know how to elevate your game. Heres to a strong finish to the semester and the promise of a bright future. Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

As I write this the sleet continues to fall here on the Chapel Hill/Carrboro town line. While it is not the beautiful snow it might have been, at least it is not the dreaded freezing rain. We still have power so we will count our blessings and hope for snow another timeperhaps as soon as Friday. Growing up in Durham I was always acutely aware of existing in that intermediate zone between the snow in Greensboro and Roxboro and the rain in Angier and Clayton. Durham could go either way, and as a child I was always envious of those who received the snow (and the snow days that went along with it). Six years spent in Connecticut took some of the charm away from the snow since they still expect you to go to work even if you get a few inches. And shoveling a driveway after the snow plows have created a wall of ice/mud/snow between your car and the street was a chore I can happily do without. Nevertheless, I do miss the beauty of a perfect snow that turns everything into a uniformly pristine landscape and lets all us Southern folks take a day or two off to appreciate its beauty. Today I will settle for half an inch of ice pellets, a hot cup of coffee and a history of Wellingtons campaign in Portugal. Fortunately, we do not need to worry about the possibility of a snow day since there is no school tomorrow as we take the day to pause and honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I had not yet turned three when on the evening of April 4, 1968, Dr. King, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, was assassinated. He was there to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city. He was only 39 years of age. It had been less than 14 years since King's role in the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955 transformed him into the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement. He was only 25 years old when he stepped into the national spotlight.What always strikes me is how young Dr. King was when he took on the burdens of leadership and decided to make a difference in the world by standing up against injustice. He did not have the luxury of a carefree young adulthood. He was called to service at an early age, and he answered that call in a way that helped start a movement that changed the world. We sometimes limit ourselves because we feel too young or too unimportant to make a significant difference, but there are so many moral acts that require little to no sacrifice. So as we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. this week, someone who made significant sacrifices for a moral cause, I encourage every one of you to take an active role in the moral arc of the universe. This week seniors will talk about our Senior Engagement and the ways they are seeking to bring positive change to our community. A host of student volunteers will share This I Believe speeches to honor the memory of Dr. King by sharing their own experiences and the things they hold close to their hearts. We have so many opportunities to shape our world, andthe dividends far outweigh the personal sacrifices. Every small act of kindness makes a difference. Together we can bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice and equity and good, honoring Dr. King and every one that believes in a better world.In speaking in honor of Dr. King, Reverend William Barber II claimed, "I do not celebrate him. We do not celebrate martyrs. You join them." Dr. King showed us the way, but there is still work to be done and we honor his legacy not with words but with actions.We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to the start of second semester and Martin Luther King, Jr. weekend. As we pause from school tomorrow to honor the Dr. Kings legacy, I hope you are making the most of this day of reflection and service. As a way of preparing for my own Sunday communication, I was moved this weekend to sit down with Dr. Benjamin Mays eulogy for Dr. King. As we confront our own national crisis brought about by the unprecedented attack on the Capitol, I sought solace from someone whose words helped a grieving nation cope with a great tragedy brought about by violence and prejudice.Benjamin Mays was a pastor and educator whose thinking laid the intellectual and moral groundwork of the American civil rights movement through his role as teacher and mentor to many influential activists, including Martin Luther King Jr, Julian Bond, and Maynard Jackson. On April 9, 1968, Dr. Mays, then President of Morehouse College in Atlanta, delivered Dr. Kings eulogy just five days after his assassination in Memphis. His words speak to a legacy of faith and hope in contrast to those who embrace violence and hate:when Martin Luther faced death again and again, and finally embraced it, there was no external pressure. He was acting on an inner compulsion that drove him on. More courageous than those who advocate violence as a way out, for they carry weapons of destruction for defense. But Martin Luther faced the dogs, the police, jail, heavy criticism, and finally death; and he never carried a gun, not even a knife to defend himself. He had only his faith in a just God to rely on; and the belief that thrice is he armed who has his quarrels just.As we seek ways to honor Dr. Kings just quarrels with segregation and racism, we can embrace opportunities to serve our community and add good to a nation in need. Our own Rise Against Hunger Club has been working throughout this year to fundraise for our annual MLK Day food packaging event. Unfortunately, because of COVID, we will not be able to have our annual packaging event on Monday. However, our students will continue to raise money in order to have our biggest and best packaging event in 2022!The leaders of the RAH club want to thank everyone who has participated and donated to this years fundraisers, and they invite everyone to the next fundraiser being organized by the entire Rise Against Hunger Organization: anonlinetrivia game called "Gather for Good" through Kahoot on Monday, January 18th.The event is free of charge to join, but donations are encouraged. All donations will contribute to purchasing medical supplies for a hospital in Haiti. There is already a DA page that has been set up, andto sign up for the trivia event, click here. Please help if you are able.As we seek to meet the challenges ahead, Dr. Mays closing words remind us that Dr. Kings torch now falls to us:I close by saying to you what Martin Luther King Jr. believed: If physical death was the price he had to pay to rid America of prejudice and injustice, nothing could be more redemptive. And, to paraphrase the words of the immortal John Fitzgerald Kennedy, permit me to say that Martin Luther King Jr.s unfinished work on earth must truly be our own.As current events would indicate, Dr. Kings work does, in fact, remain unfinished. It is we who must take up the challenge to rid America of prejudice and injustice, and in the words of Benjamin Mays: if there be prejudice in our hearts against any racial or ethnic group, let us exterminate it.As always, we will continue to speak out for the good as we wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to the start of second semester and Martin Luther King, Jr. weekend. I hope you can take a moment to pause this weekend and reflect on Dr. Kings legacy and perhaps find inspiration in the words and deeds of Dr. King. That perpetuation of inspiration was on clear display at Fridays protest march by our students in the lower school. I am always proud to be in the presence of young people who are willing to share their beliefs so eloquently and passionately. I feel such hope when I see our students living up to the high standards to which we aspire as a school. Our youngest students made signs of protest calling for equality for marginalized communities and justice for allfor attention to the climate so that they can have the future they have been promisedfor an end to gun violence, and most frequently, for kindness and love and respect for all. The march progressed from the lower school to the upper school, passing through campus as our older students paused from their work to celebrate the voices of their younger peers. Eventually the students gathered in Kenan, taking the seats they will someday assume when they arrive at the upper school. Once there, two upper school students, Brent and Mariam, read aloud from Sing a Song: How Lift Every Voice and Sing Inspired Generations by Kelly Starling Lyons (Author), Keith Mallett (Illustrator). Then Owen Bryant led all present in singing Lift Every Voice. Seeing our students and faculty come together in lifting our collective voice was both powerful and inspiring.To all our students, I want to echo the words from the book: Keep singing. Keep pushing. Keep passing it on. Keep on keeping on.To our parents and teachers, I want to encourage us all to keep faith in our children. They are compassionate and thoughtful and simply amazing.Thanks to all our lower school students and teachers for sharing your courage and your sincerity and your passion. To give voice to your concerns before the entire school with such conviction and thoughtfulness gives me hope for our future. As an educator, I often feel I learn so much from the students, and Fridays march was yet another example of students leading the way. Thank you.Our recognition of Dr. King continues this week with our Day of Service tomorrow and our This I Believe assembly on Thursday. I encourage everyone to lift your voice. We cannot all sing like Mr. Bryant, but we can all use our voices to speak out for what is right. In the words of Dr. King: Be a bush if you can't be a tree. If you can't be a highway, just be a trail. If you can't be a sun, be a star. For it isn't by size that you win or fail. Be the best of whatever you are.And always, Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone had a pleasant break and is looking forward to returning to school (virtually on Monday and in person on Wednesday). I imagine Winter Break proved to be better than last year, but for many it was still not the same as it was pre-COVID. That is certainly the case for the start of school in 2022. We will continue to roll with the punches and do our best to keep learning. We appreciate your support and flexibility as we plot a course forward.Since Monday and Tuesday will be virtual (same class schedule: Monday Day 1, Tuesday Day 2), please check your email for Teams invitations from your teachers and go ahead and turn on your MST notifications. We will not hold Morning Meeting on Monday nor advisory on Tuesday, but your classes will meet at their usual times on Teams. On Wednesday we will be back on campus for a Day 3 schedule in person.As Mr. Ulku-Steiner shared earlier this week, to protect ourselves and our community in the coming months, DA is asking our community to:Get tested after Winter Break (especially if you travelled or gathered with groups outside of your household)To reduce the chances of COVID transmission and increase our chances of uninterrupted learning, we encourage everyone to get tested prior to returning to campus. Alternatively, we STRONGLY encourage that every student and faculty member participate in the Mako Medical testing on Thursday. Please make sure you register (students, faculty/staff) by Wednesday, January 5. Testing will be offered in the Upper School Learning Commons from 3-4 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 6.Get vaccinated and boosted as soon as possibleVaccination is the most effective tool we have in reducing COVID-19 transmission and serious illness. Booster shots are particularly vital as we confront the Omicron variant. The vast majority of our faculty and staff have been boosted. Our medical advisors strongly recommend booster shots for anyone eligible, as soon as possible. Wear (better) masksThe higher contagiousness of Omicron makes cloth masks insufficient to stop transmission. Until Spring Break, Durham Academy is strongly recommending N95, KN95 or surgical masks (in that order of effectiveness) for students, faculty and staff in all divisions. Combining masks (i.e. a surgical or at least 3-ply medical mask under a cloth mask) is also more effective than either of those alone. Medical masks are available to anyone who needs one in the main office. Masks are to be worn at all times while indoors. We will continue to eat lunch outdoors when weather permits, opening the gym on those days when it is raining or below 40.Stay home when experiencing any symptoms of illness Do not come to campus if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms (all of them listed in the COVID-19 Addendum to the All-School Handbook:New or worsening cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever of 100.4 or higher, chills, new loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea. Omicrons contagiousness requires us to be conservative and clear about symptomatic community members and renew our discipline with masking and distancing protocols so that we can avoid on-campus clusters and widespread quarantining.Communicate straightforwardly and show grace for each otherThe current surge in COVID-19 infections will create anxiety and inconvenience for all of us. As always, the school will be as transparent and proactive as we possibly can. We thank you in advance for your understanding - and for your similarly prompt and transparent communication with the school.Use this portal to report any and all symptoms, exposures or diagnoses. Collaborate with the school and each other regarding absences and quarantines. January and February will require all of us to change some plans and habits. We will get through this and we will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

As we pause from school tomorrow to honor the legacy of Dr.MartinLuther King, Jr, I hope you are making the most of this day of reflection and service. As a way of preparing for my own Sunday communication, I was moved this weekend to sit down with Dr. Kings collection of sermons, Strength to Love. I have often used Dr. Kings Letter from a Birmingham Jail in my writing class as a model of eloquent, patient argumentation, and I have listened to his moving I Have a Dream speech numerous times, but this was my first real look into his sermons. In my reading, I was struck by his observation that while we may often pay lip service to our better instincts, our actions can sometimes fall woefully short. One of the great tragedies of life is that men seldom bridge the gulf between practice and profession, between doing and saying. A persistent schizophrenia leaves so many of us tragically divided against ourselves. On the one hand, we proudly profess certain sublime and noble principles, but on the other hand, we sadly practice the very antithesis of these principles. How often are our lives characterized by a high blood pressure of creeds and an anemia of deeds!Often our moral beliefs crash and burn upon the realities of our choices and actions. We think we will respond well when the ethical conundrum arrives, but have we been preparing for that moment? Can morality be summoned at will or does it require regular practice? And at what sacrifice? Kings words reminded me of PeterSingers essay Famine, Affluence and Morality, a text some of you seniors will have the opportunity to read in the Ethics course that starts on Tuesday. Throughout my years of teaching that essay, the crux of the conversation always hinges on Singers conclusion that if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it. So while most of the students agree that suffering is bad, many are overwhelmed by the moral obligation implied by the ought. The leap from could to ought can be a high hurdle, what King callsthe agonizing gulf between the ought and the is, represents the tragic theme of man's earthly pilgrimage.That ought can seem an unbridgeable chasm, too big to take in one moral leap. But morality does not always require a significant sacrifice. More often than not a moral act is at most an inconvenience that more than pays for itself with personal satisfaction and public good. We sometimes limit ourselves because we want to save the world, but perhaps we could start with small and simple acts of kindness. Small steps, taken daily, can take you a long way. What Wordsworth calls:that best portion of a good man's life, His little, nameless, unremembered, acts Of kindness and of love.So as we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. this week, someone who made significant sacrifices for a moral cause, I encourage every one of you to take a small step toward shaping the moral arc of the universe. You can help out tomorrow bypacking meals in Brumley(then stick around for the screening of Maynard in Kenan at 2:30) or you can participate candidly in this weeks advisory activity on Tuesday or you can volunteer to assist with Hope Valley Tutoring on the Middle School campus this Saturday. We have so many opportunities to shape our world, andthe dividends far outweigh the personal sacrifices. Together we can bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice and equity and good, honoring Dr. King and every one of us that believes in a better world.Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope the snow days have satisfied your need for quality family time, quiet reflection, snowman building, sledding, cocoa sipping and whatever winter activities you used to fill your days. I enjoyed the first 48 hours of being snowbound. Wednesdays snowfall was a wonder to behold as we watched our woods fill up with snow. We received 10 inches of wet fluffy snow at chez Bitterman and managed to keep our power, so it was a good day. I succeeded in getting lots of work done and started reading a very long novel (Vanity Fair), but cabin fever was setting in by Thursday evening, so Friday was spent shoveling a path that, along with a days worth of sunshine, allowed for an afternoon escape from the house. We retrieved our son, Claude, from UNCs campus and had a cozy family dinner at Kitchen, a tiny little bistro in Chapel Hill. We felt grateful for the warmth and the freedom and the company.Given the disruption to our schedule, I wanted to reiterate my message from Friday. The end of the quarter/semester brings lots of assessments for many of us, so we will be proceeding carefully as we look to make up assignments. To accommodate the missed classes, we will extend the semester by the number of days we have missed.Consequently,since school was closed for three days, we will extend the semester until Wednesday (1/24). We will continue with our class rotation as is, so Monday will be a Day 5, Tuesday a Day 6 and Wednesday a Day 7.This means that second semester classes will not begin on Monday. If you have a new second semester class, Thursday (1/25), a Day 1, will be the first day for your new class. To celebrate the new start date for the semester, we will have a new food truck on Thursday. The Cow and the Oak will be serving up grilled cheese and mac n cheese and French fries.You should have heard from your teachers over the weekend about rescheduled assignments and tests. Good luck as you make your way to the end. You still have a few miles to go before you sleep, so I hope you are well rested. We have two full weeks ahead. Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you made the most of your Snow Day.  Granted the snow arrived about 12 hours later than expected, but we had a good two inches by Saturday morning on my side of town, and this was real snow, not the ice pellets from the start of the week.  I took advantage of the extra time on Friday to get started on reading my long list of Upper School applications, but once the snow arrived I did manage to get out of the house on Saturday to take a nice long walk.  Thus are the ways of an old-school solivagant.
For those of you who prefer innovation and technology, you might be interested in the work of our Advanced Computer Science class.  Mr. Cochran informed me last week that they are working on their first machine learning project, and one of the students is learning how to use a Markov Chain  .  This student wants to feed all my Yo La Tengo emails into a program and see if he can build a chatbot that will produce a "Lanis-like" Yo La Tengo email. Like the student and Mr. Cochran, I am curious if an AI can reproduce a Yo La Tengo that would not be gibberish. Then again, perhaps that is all I am producing.
To date, based on a limited sample of YLTs from 2022, this is the best sentence so far:
"We will require all us Southern folks in the All-School Handbook: New or worsening cough, shortness of a perfect snow in the school will continue to see folks take a malfunctioning door, I can avoid on-campus clusters and good, honoring Dr. King was a cloth mask."
Like John Henry   before me, I feel that this round goes to the human.  So until we can iron out the AI wrinkles, I will continue to craft these Sunday emails unassisted by artificial means, but who knows what the future holds.  Perhaps someday I can be replaced by a robot.  Stay tuned.
For now, please pay special attention to this weeks schedule.
*	Despite the Snow Day we will keep to our daily rotation.  Monday is a Day 3.
*	We will have a Morning Meeting on Monday.  Seniors will report to Kenan and all others to advisory rooms.
*	Tuesday is an early dismissal.  All three classes (D, C, & G) will still meet for 70 minutes. Students are dismissed at 12:05 pm.
*	Seniors have a Class Meeting on Thursday.
*	We will have an Assembly on Friday to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
*	On Saturday we will host our first ever Gallery Night to showcase student art.  Drop by and see some amazing works of art.  There will be music and good times.
Heres to a great week ahead.  We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we still Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

So semester grades went out at 2:45 pm on Friday. All your hard work for the academic year so far has now been summed up into a single defining letter from a handful of characters that form the start of our alphabet. Speaking to some of you on Friday, I was left with the impression that these could make or break your weekend at a minimum or potentially even the next quarter. The question remains: what are you to do with these assessments?We teachers and administrators are not immune to the evaluation process. While you were in class this semester, I have been sitting down with Mr. Ulku-Steiner and Mrs. Klein to discuss feedback on my performance this year. This is part of DAs assessment program for administrators that asks us to spend some time gathering feedback from colleagues so that we can examine and better understand our approach to teaching and administrating. This can be a scary process because it opens one up to criticism, that ego crushing blow that causes self-doubt and internal questioning. The judgement of the other can be scary. According to Jean-Paul Sartre, this judgement is the battleground for the self as we define then redefine our identity. In doing so, we become aware of our self as object when confronted with the gaze of the Other. Feedback is tough because criticism can damage the very idea of how one sees oneself in the world. But in a world where we rely solely on the opinions of others to shape our sense of self we will eternally be disappointed. The judgement of others is scaryyou should knowwe teachers do it to you students every day. For true growth to take place we must cultivate an ability to digest, analyze, and sometimes act upon negative feedback, engaging the process with discernment, nondefensiveness, and strength, especially when we feel the feedback is not correct or fair.My suggested approach to semester grades is to take that feedback with a sense of perspective. Try to move beyond any initial defensiveness to examine the validity of the assessment. Try to balance the bad with the good, to sift the objective from the subjective, to discern the helpful from the fastidious. One of the reasons I love teaching is that I am constantly afforded the opportunity to see students master this skill that can be so difficult for adults. You constantly learn from feedback and steadily grow into the persons you will someday be. Your grades are a single snapshot from a much longer film. They show where you are, but you have the power to shape where you are going. I hope I am an example of this. I am pleased there is no video footage of just how stupid and objectionable I was as a high school student. Were I to encounter my high school self in my office I imagine it would take all my patience to deal with the unfounded arrogance and imagined aggrievance that my younger self exhibited. Fortunately, I had patient teachers and loyal friends who helped me become a better person through their candor and their support. I was not always my best self in high school, but I learned and I grew because life is a process of becominga process that continues even into adulthood.So as you look over your grades, please take the time to talk to your parents and talk to your teachers. Attempt to be honest about your strengths and open about your areas for growth. Please know that who you are now and who you will be are not the same; you always have the power to pursue your best self with the support of parents, teachers and friends. High school especially is a time of becoming and grades are merely mile markers on a much longer journey to the person you hope to be.As always, we will continue to learn and grow as we wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

So semester grades went out Friday. All your hard work for the academic year so far has now been summed up into a single defining letter from a handful of characters that form the start of our alphabet. Speaking to some of you on Friday, I was left with the impression that these could make or break your weekend at a minimum or potentially even the next quarter. The question remains: what are you to do with these assessments?We teachers and administrators are not immune to the evaluation process. While you were in class this semester, I have been sitting down with all your teachers, from Adair to Whiting and everyone in between, to discuss professional goals. This is part of DAs assessment program for faculty that asks all your teachers to spend some time gathering feedback from peers and administrators and students so that we can examine and better understand our approach to teaching and advising and administrating. This can be a scary process because it opens one up to criticism, that ego crushing blow that causes self-doubt and internal questioning. The judgement of the other can be scary. According to Jean-Paul Sartre, when others objectify my ego they are denying my existence as a subject: the existential equivalent of putting baby in the corner. Feedback is tough because criticism can damage the very idea of how I see myself in the world. In a world where we rely solely on the opinions of others to shape our sense of self we will eternally be disappointed. The judgement of others is scaryyou should knowwe teachers do it to you students every day.My suggested approach to semester grades is to take that feedback with a sense of perspective. Try to move beyond the initial defensiveness to examine the validity of the criticism. Try to balance the bad with the good, to sift the objective from the subjective, to discern the helpful from the fastidious. One of the reasons I love teaching is that I am constantly afforded the opportunity to see students master this skill that can be so difficult for adults. You learn from feedback and steadily grow into the persons you will someday be. Your grades are a still from a much longer film. They show where you are, but you have the power to shape where you are going. I hope I am an example of this. I am pleased there is no video footage of just how stupid and objectionable I was as a high school student. Were I to encounter my high school self in my office I imagine it would take all my patience to deal with the unfounded arrogance and imagined aggrievance that my former self exhibited. Fortunately I had patient teachers and loyal friends who helped me emerge from that mire of self-absorption. I was not my best self in high school, but I learned and I grew because life is a process of becoming.We are not always the person we want to be, but in a supportive environment that seeks to nurture our best selves we can learn from our mistakes and work towards the self we seek. So I will strive to be a better teacher. I will strive to be a better director. I will strive to be a better husband, parent, friend. And I will sometimes fail, but that failure will not define me. It will be the grain of sand around which I build my pearl. As one of my personal role models, Patrick Swayze, famously said..I always do the last dance of the season. This year somebody told me not to. So Im gonna do my kind of dancin with a great partner, whos not only a terrific dancer, but somebody whos taught me that there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them. Somebody whos taught me about the kind of person I wanna be.Heres to learning about the person you wanna be and the people willing to help you get there so you can do your kind of dancinLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you all had a chance to read this weeks News and Notes. There you will find lots of details about some exciting changes that are coming our way. We will be adjusting our calendar next year to allow for Maymester courses and culminating experiences, what we are calling our Cavalier Capstones. I realize this will seem exciting to some anddauntingto others; change always brings with it a little circumspection. But we are eager to take this leap of faith and better align our calendar with our mission and strategic plan.These changes align with our work onThe Mission-Driven Lifeand build on the remapping and reshaping of our curriculum to strengthen both our academic and our extra-curricular programming.The Mission-Driven Lifeis one way we have chosen to addressthe current needs and long-term futureof the whole student. Defining what it means to be happy, moral and productive is the jumping-off point for more intenseand practicalconversations. Our work as faculty members at curriculum mapping is helping us identify places where our academics and mission align, but we can do more to bring our mission to the fore. Reframing our school year is a steptowardfosteringintrinsic motivation, allowing students to pursue authentic passionsand prioritizing the traits ofThe Mission-Driven Life.So here is the plan. These ideas have been gleaned from our faculty meetings and individual conversations and are intended to provide the framework on which we will build our school year.1. Reinvesting in Senior Challenge-This is the defining trip for DA. It links our past graduates with our future alums.It has been a central experience for DA 12th graders (and Mr. Parry) for 40 years. Itdeserves aplace of prominencein our curriculum. * Friday (8/17) Gather the 12th graders for the Senior Picnic before school begins to celebrate their senior year, talk about purpose/goals, paint the bench and write personal messages, celebrate accomplishments and prepare for Senior Challenge. * Saturday (8/18) Depart for Senior Challenge early in the day. * Wednesday (8/22) Return home late in the day. * Thursday (8/23) Rest and recuperate. * Friday (8/24) Begin school with Convocation. The Seniors will enter Kenan ceremoniously after other classes have been seated. * Saturday (8/25) SAT (While not all students will be taking the SAT, we have worked to keep this date clear.)2. Juniors & Sophomores: Advisory bonding and purposeful conversations (Tuesday  Thursday, 8/21-8/23) * Summer readings that focus on self-examination,The Mission-Driven Lifeand individual purpose. * Advisory activities * Guest speakers * Community engagement activities * Personal goal settingfor the year3. True 9th grade orientation: (Tuesday  Thursday, 8/21-8/23) *Summer readings that focus on self-examination,The Mission-Driven Lifeand individual purpose. *The Mission-Driven Life * Study skills *Parent transition and orientation event(s) * Overnight bonding4. Cavalier Capstones (Post-Commencement-5/24/19): These culminating experienceswill give each studenta learning opportunity that goes beyond the traditional classroom. This change reflects more than a mere repositioning of trips. Students willnowhave a range of choices (service, leadership, academics, interdisciplinary studies, hands-on projects, outdoor education, global exploration) that complement and enhance the Upper School curriculum. From revised versions of our traditional class trips to internships to mini-courses to service projects, these culminating experiences will provide opportunities for experiences that we cannot otherwise accommodate in our academic calendar and provide students with opportunities to deepen and broaden their learning. Throughout the week of culminating experiences, a group is brought together to share ideas, cultivate friendships, gain knowledge,stretch comfort zones, see the world, develop perspectives, help others, discover beauty, build confidence, find the inner-self and make unforgettable memories.Beginning in May of 2019, the program will evolve with input from students, faculty, staff, administration, parents and alumni to provide the best experience possible.Please reach out to me with questions, concerns or complaints. As has happened already through several months of faculty conversation, I expect our plans to improve with feedback from all quarters.And do not forget that Friday is Ground Hog daymy favorite holiday of the year. A bloated whistle pig will crawl out of its burrow, take the measure of the sun and its own shadow, and through a complicated algorithm known only to the groundhog and a small cabal of scientists in a secret government lab, will determine the length of winter. I am hoping for an early spring. We have a full week ahead, so laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone had a pleasant break and is looking forward to returning to school (virtually) on Monday. I imagine Winter Break proved to be a little different for all us this year. Around here, an extended ZOOM session replaced the usual Christmas Eve family dinner in Fuqua Varina. Christmas morning was a little quieter without my parents dropping in to eat scones and see what Santa had brought (flashlights in the stockings?). Nevertheless, we soldiered on. Some traditions were lost: we can no longer shop at Morgan Imports for ornaments. Some have been postponed: extended family dinners with all the cousins and in-laws will return next year. And some traditions remain: homemade chicken and dumplings on Boxing Day is still my favorite. All in all, the holidays were not the same this year, and like most of 2020, the difference from past years was felt acutely. But we adapted, we made our own ornaments (my King cake baby emerging from a doughnut wrapper was called creepy and weird), we played Jackbox games with our family (I consistently wonmost prolific and most ignored), and we talked a lot about the promise of 2021.As we look ahead, we remain hopeful and we remain diligent. The smooth continuation of on-campus learning in January depends on the choices made during Winter Break. The CDC and NCDHHS are clear in their recommendations to avoid travel and gathering with people outside your household. If you chose to travel over the holiday season, please keep your student(s) home for 10 days after your return. Students may also return to campus after 7 days with a negative result of a PCR test administered 5 days after returning home. To facilitate testing and the safe return to campus, we are again inviting students, faculty and staff members to campus for free, drive-through PCR screening event on our Upper School campus. All students, faculty and staff members are invited to pre-register (Heres the link.) forfree, drive-through PCR screening eventon our Upper School campus during any of the following sessions.Monday, Jan. 4 from 8 a.m. to noonTuesday, Jan. 5 from 8 a.m. to noon and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.Thursday, Jan. 7 from 8 a.m. to noonPre-registration speeds the testing process for each individual and expands the number of community members we can test. To reserve a 10-minute testing window for your child(ren) or you (faculty/staff), text TESTNC to 81411 to receive a fillable form. You will find detailed instructions in Michael Ulku-Steiners email from 12/31. More information can be found atExpress Test NC.Thank you all for your support as we work towards a safe return to campus and a 2021 filled with promise and hope.Heres to starting 2021 with our best work. As always, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone was able to spend some time outdoors yesterday before the cold rains set in. Today seems pretty typical for a North Carolina winter, cold and wet, but not cold enough for snow. I, for one, will be happy to see January recede into the rearview mirror; although, to be honest, February can sometimes feel like the longest month of the year, a time when we tire of the muddy brown of winter and look ahead to spring and green things. On Tuesday we will honor our anticipation of the vernal by consulting an overweight ground squirrel who will crawl out of a hole in the earth and, based on the size and shape of his shadow and the nature of his trepidatious heart, determine the remaining length of winter. Thank you, Science!So while we wait for this slumbering rodent to pronounce our fate, I thought it might help to see what the poets have to say about February. I share the following sonnet from one of my favorite Romantic poets, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, because it captures that February feeling so well.Work without HopeLines Composed 21st February 1825All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lairThe bees are stirringbirds are on the wingAnd Winter slumbering in the open air,Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!And I the while, the sole unbusy thing,Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll:And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,And Hope without an object cannot live.--Samuel Taylor ColeridgeJudging by the tone of the poem and the final desperate couplet, I get the sense that Sam was feeling like Charlie Brown in the Valentines Day specialunloved and unappreciated. During the Victorian era, specific flowers had different meanings, and amaranths represented unrequited love or hopelessness in the language of flowers. Sam sees the signs of spring (birds and bees and flowers and, for some reason, slugs?) but despairs because, For me ye bloom not! For him, work without hope is like trying to hold a liquid in a net. It all seems like so much wasted effort.Like STC and his emo poem, I too can feel a sense of despair as I dream of Spring!especially on a cold, wet Monday morning in February when I might be inclined to pull the covers back over my head and wait out thiswinter of discontent. But whether I see my shadow or no I will rise up on Monday and embrace the day. I will arrive at school early and continue to work (with hope) for the things I believe in. Instead of guessing at Winters length, I will appreciate the days getting longer and the green things surreptitiously slipping out of the leaf clutter and I will say to myselfWinter is here, but Spring will be here soon enough. Thedaffodilsand theforsythiaand thedandelionswill soon arrive offering bright splashes of hopeful yellow in the darkness of winter. And like Charlie Brown I will once again wait patiently with the hope that this will be the year that I can fill my briefcase with Valentines.So in the spirt of hopefulness, I share these words from David Tennant, the tenth Doctor: Its all going to be okay. Trust me, Im a doctorAs long as we stand up for what we believe in, dont give in to anger or violence, look out for the little guy, keep an eye on the big guys, refuse to keep our mouths shut and just generally try not to be [jerks], he said, then every little thing is gonna be all right. This seems an appropriate blueprint for surviving Winterand pandemicsand broken hearts.Happy Ground Hog Day, all. I hope you see the shadows but remain unafraid.As always, we will continue to wait for spring while we wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to 2020. I hope Winter break treated you kindly. I finished a brace of novels (Mary Toft; or, The Rabbit Queen and The City in the Middle of the Night), ate too many Christmas cookies, went on multiple long walks and even attended a couple of shows at the Cradle. All but the cookies are on my list of New Years resolutions, so I feel really good about the start of the year. Im even sending YLT out a little early so I can attend a yoga class. Theres nothing like January for seeing folks attempt to be their best selves. Lets check back in February to see whats still actively making the list, but for now, just keep plugging away at those resolutions. In the words of my favorite stoic philosopher Epictetus, Nothing great is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig. I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen. With time and patience and diligence we can all be figsor grapes if you are into that sort of thing.I hope tomorrow finds you refreshed and ready to hit the ground running. Those alarm clocks will sound awfully early Monday morning. Embrace this last day before it all comes to an end; it is beautiful outside so take advantage of the weather and get out there. Tomorrow we will sharpen our pencils, don that new sweater nana gave us and arrive at school with a purpose. Seize the week. Perhaps you are excited about starting your Cavalier Capstone preparationon Thursday? Ortaking a run at theAtlantic and Pacific Math Contestnext Wednesday? Or attending theITPshow on Saturday? There are only ten school days left in first semester (the official end of the semester is Friday (1/17), so plenty of time to cultivate your figginess. Lets embrace 2020 and all the promise it holds.Heres to a successful and happy new year.Now more than ever:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to 2019. I hope Winter break treated you kindly. I finished a couple of novels, ate too many Christmas cookies and went on multiple long walks. I received several pairs of wool socks for Christmas and took part in a new least favorite holiday traditionthe Christmas purge. At some point during the break, my wife discovered Marie Kondo and now I have to decide if all my comics, relics and personal items (CRAP for short) spark joy. Does one really need 3 copies of Alpha Flight #1 in Mint condition? Bowling shoes? A t-shirt that says updog? Apparently, I have a low threshold for sparking joy (or questionable taste). Nevertheless, three trips to Goodwill and one truckload to the dump later, our household is a lean, mean uncluttered machineand my office at school will have a few more artifacts (all smuggled out under cover of darkness and therefore saved from the purge).I hope tomorrow finds you refreshed and ready to hit the ground running. Those alarm clocks will sound awfully early Monday morning. Embrace this last day before it all comes to an end; it is beautiful outside so take advantage of the weather and get out there. Tomorrow we will sharpen our pencils, don that new sweater grandma gave us and arrive at school with a purpose. Seize the week. Perhaps you can stop by to hear Nina Fricker on Tuesday? Or take a run at the Atlantic and Pacific Math Contest on Wednesday? Or attend the ITP show on Saturday? There are only ten school days left in first semester (the official end of the semester is Friday (1/18)), so plenty of time to spark some joy and bolster that first semester average. Lets embrace 2019 and all the promise it holds.Heres to a successful and happy new year.Looking down the roadplease note that Monday, 4 February will be a make-up day. We will follow a special Day 0 schedule, so go ahead and mark your calendars accordingly.

Welcome to the start of another school week. It was good to see folks in person last week. Despite the virtual start on Monday and Tuesday and the necessary mental and physical adjustments to rising early, by Friday we seemed to have reacclimated to the patterns of the school day. Because of a malfunctioning door, I was able to personally welcome many of our students as they entered the STEM/Humanities building Wednesday morning and noticed that many of our students have become adept at the advanced art of smizing. Throughout the day I was pleased to see everyone wearing their masks properly and doing their best to follow our COVID protocols. Fridays sub-40 degree weather and a crisp breeze meant we had lunch in the gym, but everyone did a fine job of spacing (6+ feet) and cleaning up after themselves. This group of juniors arrived early and set a great example for their peers. Thanks to all our students for handling all these bothersome but necessary protocols with grace and good humor.We started last week in virtual mode, which was a prescient move on our part given the power outage on Monday and the black ice Tuesday morning. While other school systems were closed, the upper school chugged right along. We did have several teachers at home due to mandated quarantines or closed childcare centers, but those faculty continued to teach from home while proctors helped manage classrooms (thanks to all the faculty who pitched in to help cover extra classes and to our one available sub who covered 11 out of 11 class periods from Wednesday to Friday). Our faculty and staff continue to work and plan and pivot to do everything we can to keep everyone as safe as we possible while keeping our classes operating. They continue to go above and beyond to make school happen.Throughout the week I heard from many families who expressed concerns about returning to campus and wanted to know what measures we had in place for those missing school. In fact, almost ten percent of our student population was absent last week. At this time we do not have plans to transition to a full hybrid mode because this would be adding an untenable burden to our faculty (see the above paragraph). However, I have asked our teachers to make sure their Veracross pages are robust, to make themselves available at tutorials for students who are learning at home and to demonstrate flexibility and grace with students who will be missing class for a wide range of reasons. Some teachers whose courses lend themselves to it will have hybrid options, but that is not an expectation. To further support those students who must stay at home, our Learning Specialists, Jen Rogers and Edie Evans, have also been working with faculty to make sure each class has a student scribe and that notes are posted daily on the Veracross page for all classes.We are also requesting that students who are absent email their respective teachers in anticipation of their missing classes to ask what work they can complete at home and set up a Teams meeting at tutorial on the days they are missing. We know that missing school can be stressful, so we are busily putting resources in place to support our absent population. Students, you can do your part by remaining at home when you are unwell, contacting your teachers when you are going to be absent, and availing yourself of the resources provided by the school. We can all work together to ride out this current wave as safely and as productively as possible.And one last reminder: the current surge in COVID-19 infections will create anxiety and inconvenience forallof us. As always, the school will be as transparent and proactive as we possibly can. We thank you in advance for your understanding - and for your similarly prompt and transparent communication with the school.Use this portal to report any and all symptoms, exposures or diagnoses. Collaborate with the school and each other regarding absences and quarantines. January and February will requireallof us to change some plans and habits. We will get through this just as we will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

This weekend may be rain soaked, but the week ahead promises lots of sunshine and plenty of opportunities to engage, both in person and virtually, in our school and community life. From celebrating Hispanic Heritage to the Club Fair to athletic competitions to treating yourself, this week affords everyone an opportunity to expand your understanding of others, broaden your interests, participate in school life and show yourself a little love. Every year from September 15 - October 15, we set aside time to commemorate the histories, cultures, and contributions of American citizens whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean as well as Central and South America. As we wrap up our celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month this week, please join our Upper School RAISE Leaders who have helped put together a list of challenges to encourage you to learn more about the diversity within the Hispanic community and the many positive ways these individuals contribute to the richness of American society. We encourage you to explore these resources and accept the challenge to watch a movie, read a book, visit a local Hispanic-owned restaurant, and/or listen to a podcast to learn more about our Hispanic community. If you are looking for a compelling read, I highly recommend Roberto Bolaos The Savage Detectives, and if tacos are more your style, you can never go wrong with my favorite lunch stop, La Vaquita Taqueria. Also worth noting, our fall sports teams are back in action, and our athletic department wants you to know about our mask policy for interscholastic games: DA students will wear masks while competing. Opposing teams may decide not to wear masks and we will still compete against those teams. And starting with our home events last week: Each participating member of the home teams roster (for all levels MS-JV-V) is allowed 2 Adult Spectators to attend the competition. Adults do not need to be the student-athletes legal guardian or parent but must be at least 21 years of age. This is only in effect for the home team. Visiting teams are still not allowed to bring any spectators (Please note this may change for state tournament events). All of our school protocols are in effect for our spectators:-COVID Screening /Temp taking upon arrival to campus-Spectators must maintain social distancing from other families-Face coverings must be worn at all timesOur Athletic Director, Andy Pogach, sent an email out last week with full details. It is great to have our athletes back on the fields and courts competing, and we will continue to do so safely and with plenty of school pride.Even though tomorrows forecast calls for more rain, you might want to schedule a little down time for yourself tomorrow. Put down the screens, step away from the homework for a few minutes and do something just for you. A nice walk or some quiet reflection can be a great gift.Selfcare can go a long way towards helping you manage your work load and growing into your bestself. Besides, Tuesday, 13 October, is TreatYoSelf day (Its the best day of the year), so do not be afraid to give yourselfatreat. Me, I plan on paying a visit to one of my favorite places Tuesday morning. I hope you and your families stay safe. Lets make the most of the weeks ahead. And, of course, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Happy Treat Yo Self Day! I hope you have set aside some time to honor all the hard work you do with some self care. If you are looking for a fun way to celebrate, look no further than the All School Picnic from 4-7pm today. In The Pocket (6-7pm) and XIV Hours and DARC SIDE (4-5pm) will all be there! Come support these amazing Upper School groups while hanging out with friends in the DA community and enjoying great food from five trucks: Pie Pushers, Will & Pop's, La Vaquita Taqueria, Mr. As Beignets, and Jam Ice Cream. (For the record, La Vaquita has some of the best tacos in Durham, so that should take care of your dinner plans.) This is a great way to meet families and friends across divisions. The picnic will take place at the lower school, but should it decide to rain, the show will go on in Brumley.Another exciting event scheduled this week will take place Wednesday morning. Last years Cavalier Capstones were a wonderful experience for all participants, and this year looks to be even better. On Wednesday morning our froshes, sophs and juniors will gather in advisories at 10:15 (delayed opening dont you know) before settling in to Kenan at 10:30 where faculty will present this years capstone courses. There will be almost 30 offerings that range from international travel to outdoor adventures to some deep dives into law, cooking, music, Shakespeare and more. I am particularly excited this year because I get to lead a capstone. Which one you ask? You will have to wait until Wednesday to find out.While our underclassmen are busy with the capstone assembly, our seniors will be entertained and educated by the Duke Sex Ed Squad. I recognize that sexual education can be a challenging topic for parents and teachers alike. My own parental advice to my son and daughter seems woefully lacking. Our goal for Wednesday is to offer relevant conversations about the complex emotional, social, and physical minefield that exists for our young people. Our school counselor, Shelley Danser, has been working closely with the Duke Sex Ed squad to vet Wednesdays programming because we want our students to be prepared for the world they will encounter on college campuses next year. We want you, our students, to make healthy and informed decisions in everything you do. Our mission to engender happy, moral, productive citizens extends beyond the classroom, and it is incumbent upon us to carve out time for these important matters. Looking ahead, please know that the end of the quarter will be here soon. We have a mere fortnight until the end of the marking period. This academic year has flown by so quickly. The next two weeks are going to be busy, so I hope you have a plan. Study hard. Work hard. Take care of yourselves. Make good choices.And as alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you and yours were spared the fury of Hurricane Michael. We spent yesterday hosting some friends who had a tree crash through their roof in Chapel Hill. On Friday afternoon, when it seemed the storm had passed, the wind started howling and two big oaks and a giant poplar fell in their yard; the latter landed on the roof sending branches into the upstairs bedrooms and breaking windows. Friends and neighbors have been pitching in with help clearing the debris, moving damaged boxes from the attic and providing meals until power is restored. We at Chez Wilson only experienced the minor inconvenience of a power outage for 24 hours, so we gladly played host and counted our blessings. Such events can be traumatic, but they can also bring a community together and allow us to discover our best selves. So instead of spending Treat Yo Self day (Its the best day of the year), on a long hike I had been planning for weeks, we hosted our displaced friends. The food and the stories and the laughter were the best Treat Yo Self day gift.This weeks YLT is on the long side, but it contains some exciting news. You might remember that last January in News and Notes we shared details about some exciting changes that are happening this year at the Upper School. As you already know from this Augusts Cavalier Kickoff, we adjusted our calendar to allow for Maymester courses and culminating experiences, what we are calling our Cavalier Capstones. I realize this will seem exciting to some and daunting to others; change always brings with it a little circumspection, but we eagerly took this leap of faith in order to better align our calendar with our mission and strategic plan. These changes support our work on The Mission-Driven Life and build on the remapping and reshaping of our curriculum to strengthen both our academic and our extra-curricular programming.The Mission-Driven Life is one way we have chosen to address the current needs and long-term future of the whole student. Defining what it means to be happy, moral and productive is the jumping-off point for more intense and practical conversations. Our work as faculty members at curriculum mapping is helping us identify places where our academics and mission align, but we want to do more to bring our mission to the fore. Reframing our school year is a step toward fostering intrinsic motivation, allowing students to pursue authentic passions and prioritizing the traits of The Mission-Driven Life. So here is the plan. These ideas have been gleaned from our faculty meetings and individual conversations and are intended to provide the framework on which we will build our school year. Kelly Teagarden has worked with a dedicated team of faculty members to put together a catalogue composed of proposals submitted by faculty and staff. Wednesday (10/17) will be our great unveiling; we will present our offerings with students in Kenan before sharing the link to the catalogue with both students and parents. Students will have time to consult with parents about options before they register in next week. Sign-ups will take place during Advisory Programming on 10/23 and continue through 10/28 at midnight.These culminating experiences will start after Commencement and provide each student a learning opportunity that goes beyond the traditional classroom. This change reflects more than a mere repositioning of trips. Students will now have a range of choices (service, leadership, academics, interdisciplinary studies, hands-on projects, outdoor education, global exploration) that complement and enhance the Upper School curriculum. From revised versions of our traditional class trips to internships to mini-courses to service projects, these culminating experiences will provide opportunities for experiences that we cannot otherwise accommodate in our academic calendar and provide students with opportunities to deepen and broaden their learning. Throughout the week of culminating experiences, a group is brought together to share ideas, cultivate friendships, gain knowledge, stretch comfort zones, see the world, develop perspectives, help others, discover beauty, build confidence, find the inner-self and make unforgettable memories. Beginning in May of 2019, the program will evolve with input from students, faculty, staff, administration, parents and alumni to provide the best experience possible.And for those of you who asked, last weeks premiere of Doctor Who was even better than anticipated. I look forward to the season, especially this iteration of the Doctor. I also found a little inspiration for this weeks YLT, because there is always a quoteIn the words of the new Doctor: Were all capable of the most incredible change. We can evolve while still staying true to who we are. We can honor who weve been and choose who we want to be next. This does an excellent job of summing up the work we are doing here at the Upper School with our programminghonoring who we have been, staying true to who we are while choosing who we will be next.Please reach out to me with questions, concerns or complaints. As has happened already through several months of faculty conversation, I expect our plans to improve with feedback from all quarters. As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Spirit Week ended its glorious run on Friday. A week of creative outfits (kudos to those who embraced the dress as a meme challenge) and spirited lunchtime competitions culminated in a another resounding victory for our senior class and some big home wins on Friday for our varsity tennis, volleyball and soccer teams. I almost felt bad for Cary Academyalmost. Now we can turn our attention to the end of the quarter and the upcoming fall play (Eurydice), the conference and state tournaments, and Halloween celebrations with the return of the lower school parade!I hope you have made the most of this beautiful weekend. Once the rain moved through yesterday, I was happy to see Autumn finally arrive in earnest. The temperature took a decided drop, and hopefully we will not see 80 degrees again until May. There is a big orange moon waxing gibbous to full this week (a sure sign that theGreat Pumpkinwill make his much anticipated return). During my Sunday morning run (a rather chilly one), the leaves started cascading down,yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, and now my quiet Sunday is being assailed by the petulant hum of leaf blowers. For the first time in a very long while the air is finally tinged with a deeper chill and late last night I sawOrionrising up over the horizon. It will be in the 40s when school starts tomorrow, so we can finally appreciate what my mother calls jacket weather.The week ahead promises to be a busy one, so start now working on those final presentations and essays and start studying for those tests. The coming days will be a challenge, but we can look forward to a long weekend and, perhaps, a night out at the theatre when it is all over. If you find yourself struggling this week, please reach out to your advisor or a teacher or any trusted adult. We all feel overwhelmed sometimes, and that is when it is important to know that there are friends and coaches and teachers and family members that care about you and your well being. We all want to do well, but we all carry different loads, and sometimes we need a little more help and support. The cool thing about being part of a community is that you are never alone. You are surrounded by people who care about you.There are lots of announcements below, so take some time to look through those and find a way to be a part of this wonderful community. Heres to a busy week ahead filled with lots of big assessments and even bigger performances. We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope this beautiful weekend has treated you well. We spent much of our time at Chez Wilson on Saturday working on class prep and grading for the older adults, college essays and homework for the younger adults. October is always a very busy time of year for all of us. Despite our workload, we also carved out some time for a family meeting to retrieve the Halloween decorations from the attic and make a voting plan. Voting in North Carolina started on Thursday, and we were eager to perform this most hallowed civic duty and find a time to go to the polls together. We also want to place skeletons around our yard and house. And speaking of voting planswe realize that conversations about the election can mean many things to different families, and while not everyone is comfortable with these exchanges, we recognize that the news cycle as we approach November 3rd will keep the election at the fore of the national and local conversation . As I was noting with my Ethics class last week, we tend to shy away from complicated conversations about topics that can make us feel uncomfortable, but we cannot bury our heads in the sand and ignore one another. The election will invariably find its way into our conversations in the coming weeks, and this will bring with it opportunities to rise to the challenge and present our best selves.These conversations could lead to some potentially tense moments, and tension is one of those states that most people seek to avoid. None of us likes to be uncomfortable, but as Dr. King points out in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail (last Tuesdays assigned reading in Ethics), sometimes we must be uncomfortable before we can grow as an individual, a school, a community. He points out that tension is a precursor to learning: there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. As our Head of School, Michael Ulku-Steiner, is fond of saying, we do our best work when we lean into this discomfort/tension. Many times, we must experience the tension if we are to arrive at the understanding.As the election approaches, we are likely to have these moments of tension. Throughout, we will all strive to keep our discourse respectful. And again, Dr. King provides a valuable perspective to our handling of this tension. In discussing the efforts to address segregationist laws in Birmingham, King offers an important distinction: To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust." We can bring this perspective to our conversations in the coming weeks: we will seek to understand, to listen, to find common ground. We will seek to uplift one another, and we will reject any attempts to degrade others. To echo our Mission Statement, Diversity enlivens, improves and enriches the intellectual and social environment of an academic community and encompasses all aspects of humanity including racial identity, sex, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, ability, age and gender identity. We are committed to an ongoing process to increase the diversity of our community and to implement policies, programs and practices under which all members of our community feel welcomed, empowered, responsible and safe. We are fully committed to this mission.We are committed to uplift, to not degrade, to lean into discomfort, to lead with respect and empathy, and to strive to be our best selves. We want all of our students to feel welcome, empowered, responsible and safe. In case you missed it earlier this week, Our Diversity, Equity and Engagement Team hosted a schoolwide Inclusion Night on Thursday evening via Zoom. For those of you who could not be present for the program you can follow this link and watch a recording. Just use passcode 54W?zYOe Inclusivity will continue to be our North star as we embrace our diverse voices while rejecting those voices that seek to degrade and thereby deny the humanity of anyone in our community. We will face the challenges ahead with respect for one another and a commitment to uphold the values we set out in our mission.Lets make the most of the weeks ahead. And, of course, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you made the most of this beautiful weekend before the rain set in last night. I was pleased to see Autumn finally arrive. There was a big orange moon earlier this week (for a brief moment I thought the Great Pumpkin was making his much anticipated return). On Friday I noticed the leaves starting to shift their hues to yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, causing Saturday morning to resound with the petulant hum of leaf blowers. All weekend the air was tinged with a chill I have not felt since I moved out of my old office (it is really cold in the Deans office). And when I arrived at school on Wednesday I saw Orion shining brightly over the STEM/Humanities building (Winter is coming!). Hopefully the eighty degree days are behind us and we can finally appreciate the coolness that is Fall.As I have grown older I have become more aware of the seasonal changes that take place around me. As a kid, I was also aware of seasonal changes, but they were not so much natural as cultural. I was acutely aware of the start and end of the school year. Back-to-school sales filled me with dread; the approach of June was tantalizingly slow to arrive (it still is). I paid close attention to the new television season preview in TV Guide with its full page adds for a new lineup of Saturday morning cartoons. Will this be the year they finally bring back Lancelot Link? Perhaps there will be a new School House Rock? Can Sergeant Will Corey find Joe before the authorities and clear his good name?Some things have not changedI am really looking forward to the premiere of Watchmen tonight and seeing this guy get some minutes for Duke this year and Capstone sign ups on Tuesday. And I am acutely aware of the end of the first quarter of school. It is going to be a full week of tests and papers and projects. Stay focused. Take advantage of the extended tutorials. Give yourself an occasional break to go for a walk of watch some old cartoons on Youtube. Give it your best this week then celebrate your success by sharing the joy, splendor and brightness of Diwali with friends and family next Sunday. Sneak a little of the candy that your mother is saving for next weeks Trick-or-Treaters. We will work hard this week then we will enjoy the fruits of our labor and a much deserved long weekend. Hang in there. You can do it. As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you have made the most of this beautiful weekend. Despite the rain yesterday, I was happy to see Autumn finally arrive. There is a big orange moon waxing to full this week (a sure sign that the Great Pumpkin will make his much anticipated return). On Friday the leaves started cascading down, yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, causing Saturday morning to resound with the petulant hum of leaf blowers. All weekend the air was tinged with a chill that recalls my old office (it is really cold in the Deans offices). And late last night I saw Orion rising up over the horizon. Hopefully the eighty degree days are behind us and we can finally appreciate what my mother calls jacket weather.This week also bring us to the end of the first quarter and ushers in the premiere of our fall play, The Diary of Anne Frank, a stage adaptation of the The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank. I have read and taught the diary on numerous occasions during my tenure as a teacher, and I am always moved by the wisdom and hope that permeates Anne Franks prose. I know we will have a teaser at Mondays Morning Meeting, but I wanted to provide a little context for the production.Anne and her family happened to be Jewish, living in Amsterdam under Nazi occupation. As circumstances started to look increasingly threatening, Otto Frank sought to protect his family by emigrating to America. "I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to," he wrote on April 30, 1941. "Perhaps you remember that we have two girls. It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance." However, new U.S. immigration regulations at the time meant the family could not get visas if they had any remaining close relatives in Germany. The family had to remain in Holland.In early July of 1942, the family went into hiding after one of the girls received a Nazi order to go to a labor camp, just one month after the other received a diary for her 13th birthday. For two years the family and friends remained hidden in the secret annex until the family was eventually discovered and sent to concentration camps. The two girls died of typhus on March 31, 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Two weeks later, on April 15, 1945, the 11th Armored Division liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. When they entered the camp, the soldiers were unprepared for what they foundmore than 60,000 emaciated and ill prisoners in desperate need of medical attentionmore than 13,000 corpses in various stages of decomposition littered around the camp.Otto Frank was the only member of the family to survive the Holocaust, but upon his return to Amsterdam after the war he found that Annes diary had been saved by his secretary, Miep Gies. The Diary of a Young Girl was published in 1947. I want close this YLT with one of the final entries"Its a wonder I havent abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart. Its utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation of chaos, suffering and death. I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and tranquility will return once more." Anne FrankI know this is a busy week, but please carve out some time once school is out on Thursday to see our production of The Diary of Anne Frank. It is an important reminder of what we are capable of as humans, both good and bad, and the hope that a teenage girl can inspire to make the world a better place. I look forward to seeing you there.As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Greetings from Chicago, "Hog Butcher for the World,Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;Stormy, husky, brawling,City of the Big Shoulders. Iarrived hereThursday evening with my wife to celebrate Family Weekend at UChicago. Go Phoenices! We are here to gather as much information and as many hugs as possible to last us until Thanksgiving. The weather here has been 55 and cloudy, making me miss the sunshine and real fall of North Carolina. I ran into Annie Ma (Class 2020) on campus, and she sends her regards. I am just leaving for the airport so I will be mercifully brief this morning.Monday morning means that second quarter is officially up and running. We only have twenty days of school left before Thanksgiving break. I encourage you to take some time this coming Friday and Saturday to look over your report cards. Talk to your parents and teachers and advisors about what they have to say. We teachers spent a great deal of time grading assessments and writing comments this weekend with the hope that you, the student, will gain a fuller understanding of your abilities and your potential. We are not being disingenuous when we say we would love to see you make an appointment to talk during tutorial or before a test or prior to the due date for the final draft. We are here to help you learn. Grades and comments are just one pair of tools in our kit. Please take the time to think about what your teachers have to say. Students: we are all part of a community that is working toward your best interests. Engage in the process. Next weeks advisor conferences (11/5) are all about making this experience work for you. Do not sit by and let it happen without your input. Thank you teachers, parents and students for taking the time to participate in the hard work that is education.Until then, there are lots of announcements below, so take a moment to look through those and find a way to be a part of this wonderful community.Heres to the start of second quarter. We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

It is hard to believe that the end of the quarter is upon us. The next fortnight will be an extremely busy time for students and teachers. Final projects and big tests are all coming due this week, while early college deadlines for seniors arrive next Sunday, so we must make the most of our remaining time. Check Veracross and talk to your teachers about any work that remains outstanding. To help you cope with the stress of the week, the Social Events Committee has been busy planning Halloween activities throughout the week. Work hard, but take some time to participate when you can. There is so much happening that I had to include it in an attachment. A special thanks to Blake Smith and the committee folks for hosting a wide range of seasonal activities. If I can get all my grading finished I am happy to offer lessons to all comers in the ancient sport of Corn Hole. I do not want to brag, but people who know the sport have repeatedly referred to my game as based .I hope that many of you plan to get in the spirit of things for this weeks Halloween festivities, and while I look forward to the wide range of costumes, I write to ask that you remain thoughtful in your choices. As a general rule, our costumes must be appropriate for a PG-13 audience. Thus, if the word sexy appears on the packaging of your costume you should not wear it to school. I also ask that you remain sensitive to costumes that might give offense. In general, costumes should not demean any race, religion, nationality, gender or disability. Ultimately, I ask that you treat dressing for Halloween in the same spirit that we expect you to follow the dress codewhat may be appropriate for Franklin Street is not always appropriate for our campus. If you have concerns about what to wear please check with Mrs. Frasher or me. We are happy to offer guidance or suggestions. As we wrap up this busy week and those papers and projects come due, teachers will find themselves with their own very busy weekend ahead, grading and comment writing and finishing those college recommendations. This is the most labor-intensive weekend of the year for your teachers, so we have adjusted our schedule slightly for the first week of November (see below). To accommodate comment writing we have moved our Flex Day to Monday (11/2) and we have adjusted the schedule on Wednesday (11/4) since comments are due the night before. The first drafts of comments are due on Tuesday (11/3), so we will use Wednesday morning for a faculty meeting/comment proofreading time. Students may arrive at their usual time (7:40-8:10 am), but they need not be on campus until Advisory at 9:40 am. We will be offering our usual Study Hall for students who are on campus before Advisory.On the Health and Safety front, we will be offering Flu shots this week, so please check out News & Notes to find out about how families and employees can get flu shot over the next few weeks courtesy of a partnership between DA and LabCorp. We have also updated the COVID-19 response grid and screening protocols graphic in an effort to (hopefully) make it clearer and adjust some language based on recent CDC guidelines. These protocols live in the COVID-19 Addendum to the handbook, but can also be found on the Health and Safety page of Cavs Connected:https://www.da.org/cavsconnected/health-and-safety-protocols. Thank you all for supporting these efforts to keep everyone safe and keep school open. Lets make the most of the week ahead. We will work hard, we will celebrate, and, of course, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Diwali, the festival of lights, is taking place this weekend. For many in our community, this is the most important holiday of the year. It is held on the darkest night of the new moon in Autumn and celebrates the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, hope over despair. I can get behind such a celebration; it is what being an educator is all about. In the words of Dr. King, Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Whether we celebrate Diwali or no, lets do our part to add to the light in the universe.Believe it or not, Diwali and YLT share something in common. When I started writing this weekly email as Dean of Students, I made a passing reference to a favorite band of the same name and the legend behind the phrase. Years ago, I shared the origin story, but many of those folks have graduated, so I thought a little background and a little rationale were deserved.The story as reported by Philly Sports History:One constant source of Keystone Cop mishaps [of the 1962 New York Mets] was the lack of communication between Richie Whitey Ashburn, playing center, and the Mets shortstop, a Venezuelan named Elio Chacon. Chacon didnt speak English, so when Whitey would yell I got it! I got it! Chacon would keep chasing after the ball and the two would inevitably collide, allowing the ball to fall harmlessly to earth. Finally, the teams right fielder Joe Christopher, who was bilingual, suggested that instead of yelling, I got it!, Whitey should yell Yo La Tengo! to ward off the shortstop. Ashburn and the young shortstop agreed on it, and sure enough a few games later, a pop fly went into left center, between Ashburn and Chacon. Yo La Tengo! Yo La Tengo! shouted Whitey. Chacon stopped in his tracks. Whitey reached his glove up to make the catchand got plowed over by Mets left fielder Frank Thomas, who didnt speak Spanish. Whitey and Frank fell to the ground, and the ball landed between them. As they got up to collect themselves, Howard turned to Ashburn and said, What the heck is a yellow tango?I love this story because it is a lovely parable for the miscommunication we experience in our daily lives. I know in my heart that we are all working toward the same goal as faculty, parents and students, but oftentimes a lack of communication or an unintentional miscommunication can create chaos and even some minor ill will. Like Elio and Whitey, we can work together to clarify confusion and overcome communication barriers, but unless we also include Frank, not everyone is going to be on the same page. Yo La Tengo is my humble attempt to create a common page for everyone to reference. Schedules, birthdays, lunches, college visits: I merely collate information from various sources that are available across Veracross. As in life, sometimes there will be mistakes and sometimes miscommunication will occur, but I would encourage everyone to give others the benefit of the doubt. Working together requires a lot of give and take, and listening and respect are the keys to any healthy relationship. Lets approach one another with kindness and candor. We are, after all, in this together.Here is to a week full of light and knowledge and good and hope. Happy Diwali!Make your reservations for Scapin. Congrats to an amazing fall season for our athletes. There were some heartbreaks this weekend and some amazing victories, but I couldnt be prouder of all our competitors.As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I do so hope you had a chance to see The Diary of Anne Frank in Kenan Auditorium this weekend. Our theatre program did an amazing job with this powerful production, and I could not be prouder of our school and our community for the vital message they presented. As one colleague stated so well, I am so grateful for the clarion call that our actors conveyed in warning of the dark destinations towards which hate can bring us. Indeed, the national news this week was filled with hateful acts, whether in a grocery store in Kentucky or a synagogue in Pittsburgh, there are some out there who continue to embrace hate speech and racism and antisemitism and violence. This is not who we are as a country. Those who trade in violence and violent rhetoric are wrong and deserve our condemnation. These words and acts will not be tolerated. While listening to Anne Franks powerful words this week, I was reminded that a world away in New Zealand Karl Popper was also confronting the atrocities of World War II by examining the paradox of tolerance. In his 1945 The Open Societies and Its Enemies, the philosopher examines situations where people urge us to tolerate intolerance. His response is unequivocal:Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.At times like these it is important that we reaffirm who we are as a schoolthat we speak out against intolerance that we should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant Our Diversity Mission statement states emphatically:Diversity enlivens, improves and enriches the intellectual and social environment of an academic community and encompasses all aspects of humanity including racial identity, sex, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, ability, age and gender identity. We are committed to an ongoing process to increase the diversity of our community and to implement policies, programs and practices under which all members of our community feel welcomed, empowered, responsible and safe. Amidst our diversity we stand united in the pursuit of academic excellence and development of individual capabilities.All members of our community should feel welcomed, empowered, responsible and safe. This is vital to our mission as a school and a community. Those who spread hate and violence, those who make our members of our community feel unwelcome and disempowered and unsafe are antithetical to who we are as a school, as a community, as a nation.If Anne Frank can see the promise of a better world from her refuge in the secret annex, it is incumbent upon us all to work to ensure that rational argument and love outshine the darkness of violence and hate.I again leave you with her inspirational wordsIts a wonder I havent abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.Its utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation of chaos, suffering and death. I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and tranquility will return once more. Anne FrankI look forward to being together as a community this week and working to ensure that peace will return once more. Shalom aleikhem.As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

This weeks installment ofYo La Tengomarks the real beginning of Autumn; the forecast calls for highs in the 70s all week, although it does look a little damp midweek. Interim reports have been sent home, pumpkin spice has made its much awaited return, a bowl of candy corn mysteriously appeared on my coffee table, and next Monday we have Fall Breakall sure signs of the season. AsI have said before, October is my favorite month. It suits my color palettegive me dark greens and browns any day over garish jewel tones or washed out pastels. To paraphrase Ms. Swift, let me put on my old cardigan and tell everyone its my favorite. October is also a very busy time of year. SATs were offered yesterday and PSATs are a fortnight away. Only 12 school days remain in the quarter, and college application deadlines loom on the horizon. There would seem to be too much work and not enough time. Careful planning is the only way to make it through, so pay attention to the schedule and announcements below, plan wisely and prepare to work hard. Wednesdays Community Day will allow us to step away from classes and address some of the specific skills necessary for each grade level to face the challenges that await. You might also want to schedule a little personal down time in your week. Put down the screens, step away from the homework for a few minutes. A nice walk or some quiet reflection can also do the trick. Self-care can go a long way towards helping you manage your work load and grow into your best self. Balance, one of our character traits of a DA grad, is not unlike theSasquatch. Often discussed, occasionally glimpsed, but hard to realize in person. Balance requires being deliberate about finding the time for all the things we care aboutwork, family, friends, ourselves. Time is a limited resource, so we must build all of these into our schedules. When I can step away from my laptop and the emails this week, I plan on spending a little time around the fire pit this week with a book and a cold glass of buttermilk and a new playlist to suit the weather.Heres to a busy week ahead with some time carved out to care for ourselves and others. We will continue to wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

And Happy Diwali to those of you who celebrate. Diwali, the festival of lights, is taking place this week (Thursday 11/4). For many in our community, this is the most important holiday of the year. It is held on the darkest night of the new moon in Autumn and celebrates the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, hope over despair. I feel the attraction of such a celebration; it is what being an educator is all about. And it does not always require grand gestures to make a difference. As Anne Frank observed, Look at how a single candle can both defy and define the darkness. Whether we celebrate Diwali or no, lets do our part to add to the light in the universe.And speaking of light in the universe, many of you know, I am a bigDoctor Whofan and season 13 kicks off tonight! From Tom Baker to Jodie Whittaker andall the Doctorsin between, I love the Doctor. And one element of the show that always fascinates me is the concept of time travel. From years of watching the show I have learned a lot about the subject. Meeting your past self can cause irreparable damage to the time stream. Certain events are unchangeable, and crossing into established events is strictly forbidden. And then there is the big one: even small disturbances to the environment in the past can cause unforeseen consequences in the future. That last one always gets me thinking: what if we apply that theory to the present? What if small changes to the present can we make a big difference in the future?Hmmmm?This week, as the second quarter is up and running at full speed, take some advice from the Doctor. I encourage you to take look over those report cards that went home on Friday. Talk to your parents and teachers and advisors about what your teachers had to say. Our faculty spends a great deal of time grading assessments and writing comments with the hope that you, the student, will gain a fuller understanding of your abilities and your potential. We are not being disingenuous when we say we would love to see you drop by during tutorial or before a test or prior to the due date for the final draft. We are here to help you learn, to bring light to the darkness. Grades and comments are just one pair of tools in our kit. Please take the time to think about what your teachers have to say. We are all part of a community that is working toward your best interests. Engage in the process. Your teachers will be available this week to discuss ways to make those small changes that can make a big difference in the future. This Fridays parent conferences are all about making this educational experience work for you. Our work together is ongoing, and we should approach it with commitment and humility and dedication.Were all capable of the most incredible change. We can evolve while still staying true to who we are. We can honor who weve been and choose who we want to be next.--The Thirteenth DoctorUntil then, there are lots of announcements below, so take a moment to look through those and find a way to be a part of this wonderful community.Heres to the process of becoming our best selves as we stay true to ourselves. We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

This weeks installment of Yo La Tengo marks the real beginning of Autumn. Interim reports were sent home last week, the weather has turned chilly of a morning, a bowl of candy corn mysteriously appeared on my coffee table, and next Monday we have Fall Breakall sure signs of Autumn. As I have said before, this is my favorite season. It suits my color palettegive me dark greens and browns any day over garish jewel tones or washed out pastels. Let me put on a cardigan and make that Fred Rogers look work. October is also a very busy time of year. SATs were offered again yesterday. I know because I arose at 6:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning and made the drive out to Eastern Alamance High School. (Thanks, College Board for the opportunity to explore rural Alamance county and see the sun rise over the Haw River.) Looking ahead, only four weeks remain in the quarter. College applications loom on the horizon. There would seem to be too much work and not enough time. Careful planning is the only way to make it through, so pay attention to the schedule, plan wisely and prepare to work hard. Teachers will be posting class meetings in Teams at the start of the week to assist with this process. Staying organized is an important tool to staying on top of your game. Please reach out to your teachers if you have questions or concerns. They remain available for scheduled tutorials, and clarity can often dispel the anxiety that comes from confusion.And please take some time to look through the Announcements this week. Some clubs have started meeting, and next week we will finally have our Club Fair. There will be lots of opportunities to get involved and pursue interests beyond academics. The weather this week looks inviting, so you might want to include a little down time in your schedule. Put down the screens, step away from the homework and sit quietly for a few minutes. A nice walk can also do the trick. There are some quiet trails along the Haw River that are worth exploring if you have the time. However you approach this month, please know that there is a beauty to October. We just need to give ourselves the space to appreciate it.I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.  L.M. Montgomery, Anne of Green GablesI hope you and your families stay safe. Please keep those who are sick and suffering in your thoughts and prayers. We have lost too many people to this virus, and we must remain vigilant in maintaining our health protocols. As such, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

This weeks installment of Yo La Tengo marks the real beginning of Autumn; the forecast calls for highs in the 70s all week and is that a low in the 40s for Friday night? Interim reports went home last week, pumpkin spice has made its much awaited return (BTW so has the McRib), a bowl of candy corn mysteriously appeared on my coffee tableall sure signs of Autumn. As I have said before, this is my favorite season. It suits my color palettegive me dark greens and browns any day over garish jewel tones or washed out pastels. Let me put on a beige cardigan and take a stroll through falling leaves and all is right with the world. But October also brings a very busy time of year. SATs were offered yesterday. PSATs are a fortnight away. Only thirteen (13) school days remain in the quarter. College applications loom on the horizon. There would seem to be too much work and not enough time. Careful planning is the only way to make it through, so pay attention to the schedule and announcements below, plan wisely and prepare to work hard. I recommend a color coded calendar to keep track of everything. I also recommend that you take advantage of tutorial. Spending a little one on one time with your teacher can do a world of good. It is the best way to clarify confusion, get that bit of extra help that can make a difference on that next assessment and show your teachers how invested you are in the learning process. You might want also want to schedule a little down time in your week. Put down the screens, step away from the homework for a few minutes. A nice walk or some quiet reflection can do the trick. Self care can go a long way towards helping you manage your work load and growing into your best self. Also, next Sunday, 13 October, is Treat Yo Self day ( Its the best day of the year ), so do not be afraid to give yourself a treat. Me, Ive got my eye on the new WILCO and Angel Olsen albums.Congrats to our Student Government on hosting a great Spirit week and congrats also to all out athletic teams. It was an impressive showing by all our teams on Friday. And speaking of impressive, if you want to see our girls tennis team take their undefeated streak to some of your favorite faculty members, check out the faculty-student tennis match this Tuesday at 4:30. I will be there doing my best impersonation of Evonne Goolagong.As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are appreciating this long weekend. Yesterday was a bit dreary, but the sun is shining today. I for one am excited for this new day because the new season of Doctor Who premieres at 1:45 pm, and Jodie Whitaker will take over the role of the Doctor. For those of you who do not know, the Doctor is the last living Time Lord (depending on your time stream), and Time Lords have the ability to regenerate, coming back in different bodies with different personalities. Whitaker will be the thirteenth iteration of the Doctor, and I have been a fan since I discovered the show on PBS one Saturday afternoon in 1975 when Tom Baker, the fourth Doctor, was putting his particular spin on the role. Jodie Whitaker will be the first female actor to portray the Doctor, although Tom Baker originally suggested in 1981 that the fifth Doctor might be a woman. Thirty seven years later his prediction comes true. Of course, casting a woman in a role that had been played by male actors since 1963 was not without some backlash, but Colin Baker, the sixth Doctor offered the best response to the naysayersThe world we live in has a history of male domination, of stereotyping, of resistance to change, of playing it safe. Doctor Who has never been about that. The Doctor in all his incarnations has always been a passionate defender of justice, equality, fairness and resisted those who seek to dominate or destroy.Colin Baker, 17 July 2017Defending justice, equality and fairness. Resisting those who seek to dominate and destroy. Doctor Who is just a silly television show, but it taught and continues to teach me invaluable lessons, and I will always be grateful because ultimately it is a show about hope: hope that we can rise to the challenges that face us and in those moments of crisis discover our best selves. People are always surprised when they hearmy phone ring. Some smile in recognition others ask, what is that noise? I always reply, Its the sound of hope. As the newest iteration of the Doctor says, Sometimes I see things that need fixing and I do what I can. Hope is a precious gift.So in recognition of this day and the newest Doctorhere are some fun facts (perhaps opinion is more accurate) about Doctor Who:Tom Baker will always be my favorite Doctor because he is the one that introduced me to this madman with a box.David Tennant is my favorite modern Doctor.Matt Smiths Doctor had the best companions in Amy Pond and Rory Williams.While bow ties are cool, the first doctor had a monocle. Monocles are so much cooler than bow ties.The weeping angels are my favorite villains/monsters.Never gaze into the Time Vortex through the Untempered Schism.The third Doctor practiced Venusian Aikido. I once defeated a Dalek using Venusian Aikido.Yes, that is how one looks when using Venusian Aikido against a Dalek.As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to November. I hope the extra hour of sleep last night and the beautiful weather on Saturday served as a tonic. After a feverish Friday spent grading and comment writing, I carved out a little space on Saturday for some family time and Halloween celebrating. We made pumpkin bread, dressed as the Beatles (I was Paul), and visited both the book store (Flyleaf) and the record store (Schoolkids). We even tried to recreate the Abbey Road cover while crossing Franklin Street. I scored an Ann Leckie novel and the new Mountain Goats album. We wrapped up the day with some homemade pizzas (anchovy for me) and the 1974 horror classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Overall it was great way to reconnect, prepare for the busy week ahead and reconsider becoming a vegetarian.Before we start looking too far ahead, I need to offer a standing ovation to everyone who helped put together The Comedy Show, Episode 1: Fall Into Comedy. The Upper School Theatre Company put together an amazing show on Thursday. My family certainly enjoyed laughing at one particular skit that was very loosely based on certain Durham Academy administrators. If you have not had a chance to see the show yet, or you want to watch it again, it will be available through Monday on the US Theatre Vimeo page. Having recharged my emotional batteries and pre-polished my monocle, I am looking forward to the week ahead. November for me is all about service and duty and gratitude. We will celebrate the democratic process on Tuesday by exercising our duty as citizens to make our voices heard. If you are old enough and have not done so yet, I encourage every member of our community to vote on Tuesday. I took advantage of early voting and cast my ballot last week. It is a powerful feeling to participate in such a vital process. This week also means that second quarter is up and running. We only have thirteen days of school left before Thanksgiving break. I encourage you to take some time this coming Friday and Staurday to look over those report cards. Talk to your parents and teachers and advisors about what they have to say. We teachers spend a great deal of time grading assessments and writing comments with the hope that you, the student, will gain a fuller understanding of your abilities and your potential. We are not being disingenuous when we say we would love to see you make an appointment to talk during virtual tutorial or before a test or prior to the due date for the final draft. We are here to help you learn. Grades and comments are just one pair of tools in our kit. Please take the time to think about what your teachers have to say. Students: we are all part of a community that is working toward your best interests. Engage in the process. Next weeks parent conferences (11/13) are all about making this experience work for you. Do not sit by and let it happen without your input. Thank you teachers, parents and students for taking the time to participate in the hard work that is education.As I mentioned last week, this is the most labor-intensive weekend of the year for your teachers, so we have adjusted our schedule slightly for the first week of November (see below). To accommodate comment writing we have moved our Flex Day toMonday (11/2)and we have adjusted the schedule on Wednesday (11/4)since comments are due the night before. The first drafts of comments are due on Tuesday (11/3), so we will use Wednesday morning for a faculty meeting/comment proofreading time. Students may arrive at their usual time (7:40-8:10 am), but they need not be on campus until Advisory at 9:40 am. We will be offering our usual Study Hall for students who are on campus before Advisory.Lets make the most of the week ahead. We will work hard, we will vote, and, of course, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Having used this weekend to recharge my emotional batteries, I am looking forward to the coming weeks. In honor of Veterans day, we will take some time during our community meetings this week to recognizeour veterans and share our gratitude for those who have served. November for me is all about duty and service and gratitude. We celebrated the democratic process last Tuesday by exercising our duty as citizens to make our voices heard. I hope that every member of our community that is old enough voted on Tuesday. I picked up my son from UNCs campus and we spent some time researching candidates and positions before swinging by our voting site to participate in this noble rite. It is a powerful feeling to participate in such a fundamentally important process. Tomorrow we will dedicate our morning meeting to recognizing Veterans Day and on Thursday we will hold our annual Veterans Day assembly. This is always a special day because it affords us an opportunity to show our gratitude for those who have stepped forward to protect our country at the risk of great personal sacrifice. Thank you, Mr. Adair and your class for making this happen.As we look to the weeks ahead, we have only twelve school days left until we break for Thanksgiving, but those days are just packed. Check out the announcements below for lots of opportunities to get involved in our community. TDA workshops, musical tryouts, Turkey Trot, Nightfall, Maths Contestsand so much more. Propose a workshop, belt out a showtune, go on a run, bust a dance move or test your maths skills. These are all great opportunities to discover and share your gifts. Given my limited musical talents and rusty maths skills, I have been focused on training for the Turkey Trot and hope to finish injury free this year (as we age the definition of winning changes slightly). I hope you will make the effort to carve out some time in your busy schedule to see all that our school and community have to offer beyond the classroom.As we reflect this week on duty and service and gratitude, I am reminded of one of many beautiful quotes from Anne Frank: How lovely to think that no one need wait a moment, we can start now, start slowly changing the world! How lovely that everyone, great and small, can make their contribution toward introducing justice straightaway... And you can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness!I look forward to all of us making our contributions this week. You need not wait a moment. Just get started. And as alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you can take the time today to acknowledge Veterans Day and thank someone for their service. I always spend time on this day recalling my grandfather, Claude Wilson, who lost a foot to a land mine in the Ardennes Forest and concluded WWII as a prisoner in a German POW hospital. He left three kids and a wife behind in Durham to go fight Nazis who were committing atrocities in Europe. I am grateful for his service and his sacrifice and his character. He always claimed he was lucky because, though he lost a limb, he was able to return home and see his children and grandchildren grow up. He meant a great deal to me, so much so that I named my own son, Claude, after him. I hope I, as an individual, and we, as a country, can live up to the standards so many of our countrymen sacrificed so much to protect. On this day we should remember the cost to those who served, fighting to end wars and make peace possible. To all those who servedthank you and we remember.As we look to the week ahead, we have only seven school days left until we break for Thanksgiving, but those days are just packed. Check out the announcements below for lots of opportunities to get involved in our community. Exurbia submissions, Turkey Trot, Nightfall, Maths Contestsand so much more. Write a poem, go on a run, bust a dance move or test your maths skills. These are all great opportunities to discover and share your talents. I have been training for the Turkey Trot and hope to finish injury free this year (as we age the definition of winning changes slightly). Make the effort to carve out some time in your busy schedule to see all that our school and community have to offer beyond the classroom. One of the big opportunities we will have this week and next will involve inviting others to our school. On Monday (11/12), we will have our student visit day, so many of your peers will be hosting a guest who is considering attending our school next year. Then next Monday (11/19), we will host prospective families for our tour and information session. You are likely to see some folks visiting classrooms and milling around campus. Welcome them with a smile and feel free to share with them what DA is all about. This is our chance to shine and allow others to share a glimpse of our daily lives. Generosity, respect and kindness are the key words for this week and next.As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone is making the most of this beautiful weekend. When the sun sits so low in the sky, especially at mid-day, I am reminded of a line from Emily Dickinson about a certain Slant of light that heralds the arrival of Winter. Dickinsons poem has a somewhat ominous overtone (the final word is Death), but there is something about bright sunshine on a cold day with the crunch of leaves underfoot that has that sad but stirring quality that I associate with the first true frost of the year. Yes, Winter is coming but with it the promise of holidays and family gatherings and pie.This is also the season of ITP concerts and Veterans Day assemblies and basketball games. (Is it just me or does it seem like Duke plays every day?). The last week or so of school has started to feel like a year that has all the pre-COVID signs of normalcy. Even at half capacity, it felt good to be back in Kenan Auditorium to hear our guest speaker, Jon Enberg US Navy and DA Class of 1998, at an old fashioned assembly or to return later that day to Kirby Gym to cheer on the boys varsity team as they rallied in the fourth quarter only to lose a heartbreaker in the closing minute or to get back to Kenan on Saturday to hear music, loud and uplifting, from the stage of our auditorium. The opportunity to come together and feel part of something bigger is just as vital to our community as our academic work. Throw in signing ceremonies and gratitude projects and Cavalier Conversations and this week felt good.Also this week we kicked off one of our longest running traditions at Durham Academy. As I mentioned in an email earlier this week, for the past 44 years, our advisories have participated inShare Your Christmas by helping to sponsor a Durham community member for the holidays. Advisories will receive a profile next week that contains their recipients wish list and the instructions for sponsoring. During the week before Thanksgiving advisories will shop for their family member, buying gifts that are requested by the individual, spending between $65-$80. The gifts are then wrapped and labeled so Upper school teachers, William Edwards and Mike Meyer, can once again deliver all the gifts to the collection station at Yates Baptist Church.We hope to sponsor 44 families (one for each advisory) by raising $3000, and I am pleased to announce that we have raised $1000 already.Thanks to all who responded so quickly and so generously.We will continue to collect cash ($5-$10) at the upper school front desk (ust drop it in the wrapped gift box) or you may also contribute through Paypal (deanbitterman@gmail.com) or Venmo (@Lanis-Wilson).Heres to bringing our community together, to celebrate our gifts together and to share that spirit with the greater Durham community. We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope conferences went well on Friday and you all are ready to face the week ahead with a renewed sense of purpose and a better understanding of the resources and support available. This year has thrown myriad complications in our path, but I am extremely proud of the way our community has rallied together to overcome these obstacles. We have one week left before our weeklong Thanksgiving Break, but the week ahead is full of wonderful opportunities to learn and grow together.For many in our community, Diwali, the festival of lights, took place over the weekend. Held on the darkest night of the new moon in Autumn, Diwali celebrates the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, hope over despair. I can get behind such a celebration; it is what being an educator is all about. In the words of Dr. King, Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Whether you celebrateDiwalior no, lets do our part to add to the light in the universe. In that spirit, we are pleased to welcome award-winning author, Julie Lythcott-Haims back to our campus (virtually, of course). Please join us Thursday, November 19 from 7:00  8:30 p.m. for her encore visit. The evening will consist of a discussion of her book, Real American, sharing her journey as a Black and biracial woman navigating predominately white spaces. If you can, please drop in on Thursday evening to hear Lythcott-Haims' personal narrative on how she dealt with microaggressions, discrimination and racism. Learn strategies on how to talk to your child about race, modeling inclusive behavior and overcoming bias. Zoom Meeting ID: 867 8801 3563 Passcode: JLHatDAAlso, we will wrap up this week with our final Community Day for 2020. You should have received an email from Mrs. Danser with details for your class, but I have included the basics below in our fortnight schedule. Each class will be working together through our advisory groups to participate in age appropriate programming. Please join us.And finally, one more chance to support Durham Academy and feel a part of something bigger. If you have not done so already, please Sign up nowfor our Annual Turkey Trot! The cost is $10 per entrant. You need not be a runner to participate. I plan on walking my way to the top of the leaderboard, starting as soon as I hit send on YLT with a nice six mile hike this afternoon. Heres wishing everyone in the DA family a Diwali that brings us closer to our goal of a moral, happy, productive life. As always, we will continue to learn and grow together while continuing to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are doing well. As the unseasonably warm October fades into the rearview mirror and we gaze longingly at Thanksgiving on the not too distant horizon, I like to pause and appreciate the turn in the season. A couple of weeks ago we fell back an hour, and while our mornings are a bit brighter, the days feel so much shorter as we creep towards the Winter Solstice. Last week was cold and wet, and I felt trapped indoors on too many afternoons, but this weeks forecast promises to be a little more inviting. I anticipate some crowds on the new outdoor commons this week. To help you appreciate the last full week of classes this month, heres a little poem about November. Something to think about as you enjoy the cool temperatures for todays Turkey Trot.NovemberShow's over, folks. And didn't October doA bang-up job? Crisp breezes, full-throated criesOf migrating geese, low-floating coral moon.Nothing left but fool's gold in the trees.Did I love it enough, the full-throttle foliage,While it lasted? Was I dazzled? The beesHave up and quit their last-ditch flights of forageAnd gone to shiver in their winter clusters.Field mice hit the barns, big squirrels gorgeOn busted chestnuts. A sky like hardened plasterHovers. The pasty river, its next of kin,Coughs up reed grass fat as feather dusters.Even the swarms of kids have given inTo winter's big excuse, boxed-in allure:TVs ricochet light behind pulled curtains.The days throw up a closed sign around four.The hapless customer who'd wanted somethingArrives to find lights out, a bolted door.BY MAGGIE DIETZIf the weather has you down and Thanksgiving seems too far away, you need just look ahead to Saturday for some inspiration. Have you ever wanted to see some of your favorite teachers take the stage and perform in Kenan? If so, then you are in luck. Please join In The Pocket and special guests for our annual fall show benefiting Rise Against Hunger this Saturday, November 23, at 7:30 PM in Kenan Auditorium! ITP is excited to share the stage with some special guests, DA faculty members! Our confirmed list currently includes:Jordan AdairJeff BiersachJames BohanekOwen BryantRyan BurtonAmy CraigHaley HelveyJarrod JenzanoErika McCarthyKat PosadaLori ReadeWhat an exciting lineup! Admission is free, but as usual we will be collecting donations for Rise Against Hunger to support the meal-packaging event on the MLK Day of Service in January. Come support students and faculty making great music for an excellent cause. See you Saturday! Lets finish November with our best work no matter what the weather holds in store. In the words of this November classic: So never mind the darkness / We still can find a way / 'Cause nothin' lasts forever / Even cold November rain.And as alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Only two more school days until Thanksgiving break. I know you can make it. I am looking forward to this much deserved respite and intend to spend a great deal of time eating pie and playing with my family. On Tuesday evening I plan to celebrate early by having my parents over for a large family dinner. On Wednesday, I will make the trek to Washington, D.C. to spend Thanksgiving proper with my wifes family. Along with a few museum visits, I also have an appointment at Milk Bar in D.C. to grab this very special pie. So that you all may make the most of this time with your families, I want to remind everyone of the official Upper School policy concerning homework over the breakHomework over vacation: There will be no assignments over vacation periods, allowing students to have true vacations. Normal homework assignments in preparation for the first day of school after vacation and long-term assignments that students choose to leave for vacation are permissible.Each of your teachers may assign 30-45 minutes of homework over the break, so you are ready to hit the ground running next Monday. I, however, am going to use the power invested in me by the Board of Trustees and Mr. Ulku-Steiner to once again assign the following tasks over the break to help you discover the HAPPY part of the Mission Driven LifeYour assignments:1. Three Good ThingsAt the end of each day write down three good things about that day. They can be big ("I met the love of my life!) or small (I found a quarter!!!); just write them down. Keep a list of these good things for a full week.2. Awareness WalkTake a thirty minute walk and pause each time you notice something positive. Take a moment to appreciate the color of a leaf, the cry of a hawk, the wind against your cheek, water cascading over a rock. Some of these items might even make it on your Three Good Things list.3. Meaningful PhotosYou always have your phone with you. Instead of taking another selfie, take a picture (or 2 or 7) of things that have meaning to youa family member, a pet, a childhood book or toy. Start a file in your phone. Next Sunday take 30 minutes to reflect on those images and the happiness they bring to your life.4. Random Acts of KindnessBuy a coffee for a stranger. Pick up some litter. Smile at a passerby. Volunteer to help cook dinner or wash the dishes. Do at least one kind act intentionally each day.5. Thank You NotesWrite a thank you note to someone who cares about you. You will be glad you did.6. SleepGet 8-10 hours each night. Your body and your mind will thank you.7. ExerciseFeel those endorphins coursing through your body and elevating your mood.8. Practice MindfulnessDownload an appthat has a guided meditation. Just 20 minutes can do all sorts ofgood for your brain parts.9. Listen to an albumIm not talking about having music playing in the background. Im talking drop the needle, sit back in your beanbag chair and just listen to an album. This is especially ideal if you are traveling over the break. I highly recommend HC McEntires Lionheart orCharlie Chestermans Studebakersfield.10. Play with/like a little kidAt some point over the break you might encounter that younger cousin or neighbor or sibling. Break out the Legos or Guess Who? or Quidditch broom and play like you did when you were 9. If there are no young kids around, beg a grandparent to play with you. Rediscover your youth.11. Eat PieI am not certain there is any science to support this, but just thinking abouteating piemakes me happy.Other than offerings of pie, I will not be collecting the homework, but you should give these assignments a try. You will be happy you did.As always, but especially for those of you participating in the Turkey Trot this afternoon:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Please read the following sentence aloudThursday is Thanksgiving, my favorite day of the year because I love watching the Thanksgiving Day Parade."Did you notice that you pronounced Thanksgiving differently each time? The first sounded like "thanks GIVING (emphasis onGIVING) and the second like "THANKS giving (emphasis onTHANKS). Give it another try if you do not believe me. Words are cool and humans are weird. Either way you pronounce it both parts of Thanksgiving are clues to the secret of happiness, both hedonic and eudaemonic. Expressing gratitude and selfless acts have both been shown bySCIENCEto increase happiness in individuals.We will talk a little more about Gratitude and Giving during Tuesdays advisory time when we talk about our support forShare Your Christmasby helping to sponsor a Durham community member for the holidays.But I also wanted to useYLTto assign a little homework over Thanksgiving. Officially, here is the Upper School policy concerning homework over the breakHomework over vacation: There will be no more than a single nights worth of homework over vacation periods, allowing students to have true vacations.

I am looking forward to this much deserved respite and intend to spend a great deal of time eating and playing with my family. On Monday I will celebrate early by having my parents over for a large family dinner that will involve my dads favorite dessert: banana pudding. On Tuesday evening, we will head up to Chicago to visit some area colleges on Wednesday and spendThanksgivingthere with my immediate family. Along with a few museum visits, I also plan to see Spamalot and eat something called deep-dish pizza. The latter strikes me as antithetical to my pizza aesthetic, but I will be bold and try something new.So that you all may make the most of this time with your families, I want to remind everyone of the official Upper School policy concerning homework over the breakHomework over vacation: There will be no extra assignments over vacation periods, allowing students to have true vacations.

I hope you have had a wonderful Thanksgiving break. The Wilsons made the arduous trek to D.C. to visit my wifes family. On Wednesday, we had a great late lunch at Mama Js in Richmond. I highly recommend the catfish and cornbread. The coconut cake with pineapple is also a great pre-Thanksgiving dessert for those looking to expand your waistline in anticipation of Thursdays feast. Although I prefer to remain at home, I actually like the drive to Petersburg through southern Virginia. We always stop in Richmond to eat, but the 100 mile stretch from Richmond to D.C. leaves me exhausted. When is it not rush hour on that stretch of 95? It was a great opportunity to practice patience, defensive driving and smile therapy. How did you do on your pre-Thanksgiving assignments? Despite being away from home, I feel pretty good about my homework.1. Three Good ThingsI am grateful for my wife and two children (Mary, Claude and Maddie). They are my support and my joyeven if they do mock me mercilessly when we play Apples to Apples or when I share a song I wrote about George Washington when I was in third grade. Spending time with my family makes me appreciate my life. They make me laugh and they keep my ego in check.2. Awareness WalkFriday was wickedly cold in DC (a high of 33), but we walked from our flat next to Dunbar High to the Smithsonian and spent hours milling around the Natural History museum and the American History museum. While I prefer nature, the Natural History museum is a passable substitute. As a child, I marveled at the dioramas, and I still get that feeling when I enter the museum and see that bull elephant in the lobby. I also love walking in cities and getting a feel for neighborhoods and communities.3. Meaningful PhotosSee attached. My daughters favorite displays were the Swedish chef, the diorama with a capibara and the full-scale replica of Julia Childs kitchen. Who says rodents and the culinary arts cannot mix?4. Random Acts of KindnessI bought coffee for the couple behind us in line, and I helped an older woman sweep the leaves off of her stoop and sidewalk. Apparently, all the gingko trees lose their leaves on Thanksgiving day in DC. The streets looked like they were paved in gold on Friday. 5. Thank You NotesI wrote several and I received some.I am especially grateful to my brother-in-laws girlfriend, Kristy, for making the first green bean casserole that I ever liked. It was delicious and I am now a big fanof Kristy and the casserole.6. SleepWhile it is hard to sleep properly in a strange place, I grabbed 9 hours last night and plan to get 8 tonight. I will be ready for the run up to exams on Monday.7. ExerciseDespite the cold weather, I made sure to walk everywhere in DC. Even when my family insisted on taking an UBER, I walked the two miles back to our flat. I logged almost nine miles on Friday.8. Meditate20 minutes every day.9. Listen to an albumI went old school for the car trip and selected several CDs for the drive. Kate Bushs The Hounds of Love, Becks Odelay and Southern Culture on the Skids Liquored Up and Lacquered Down helped me survive the long drive.10. Play with/like a little kidDespite the mockery mentioned above, I gave 110% to the Apples to Apples marathon. I even forgave Kristy in my thank you note for failing to pick Will Smith as Magical and causing me to lose to my mother-in-law. 11. Eat PieDerby, pumpkin and crack pies. I hit the trifecta!There is still time to complete your tasks. Today promises to be 60 degrees and sunny, so take advantage of this beautiful day we have been given. I would also encourage everyone to take some time and check out the fortnight schedule below. Exams are a mere three weeks away. Now would be a good time to plan for upcoming projects and essays and exams. There is a lot to get done in the next three weeks, so start now. Make a list, consult your calendar, and commence getting things done. We have recharged our batteries and now it is time for the final sprint.In the words of one of my favorite poets, Declan Patrick MacManus: "Welcome to the working week / Oh, I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you / Welcome to the working week / You gotta do it till you're through it, so you better get to it"As always: Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone had a pleasant Thanksgiving break. I remain grateful that my children, Maddie and Claude, were able to be home for the week and that there is stillleftover pie(one slice of pumpkinI hid in the back of the refrigerator). My wife, Mary, and I have been living a quieter existence since both kids left for school in September, so we were looking forward to having them back home for some quality family time. We had some modest expectations for the week, but not all plans unfold as we hope, or as Robert Burns would sayThe best laid schemes o Mice an Men Gang aft agley,An leae us nought but grief an pain, For promisd joy!My daughter arrived last Saturday from Chicago, and, unfortunately, she brought more than just dirty laundry home with her. She seemed well on Saturday, but a night of coughing on Sunday lead to a COVID test on Monday. Fortunately, the results were negative, but thinking it might be a sinus infection, one visit to the doctor on Tuesday and one flu test later revealed that she had the flu. We commenced a regimen of Tamiflu and vitamin C for her and hoped our flu shots would protect us. Alas, my wife stated getting sick on Tuesday night, my son and I followed on Wednesday, and we all had the flu just in time for Thanksgiving. We persevered. We cooked all day on Thursday and had a beautiful meal at 4:00 with turkey and all the trimmings, but we all succumbed around 7:00 and went to bed. No Settlers of Catan, no movie night, nothing but Nyquil and sleep. While not exactly the Thanksgiving we had imagined, we were grateful to have everyone home and no work obligations and the opportunity to rest and recover. Maddie left yesterday to fly back to Chicago feeling much better. Claude heads home today with a runny nose but on the mend. My wife and I will continue to recover and shift our hopes to Christmas and winter break.I share all this because if you travelled over the break or were with folks who travelled, it is important to follow CDC guidelines. We expect that DA families traveling with younger children or unvaccinated Middle and Upper Schoolers will test and quarantine as indicated in the CDC guidelines fordomestic travelandinternational travel. Unvaccinated Upper School students who travel and need to self-quarantine will have access to Veracross and can email their teachers to hold virtual meetings during tutorial the week after Thanksgiving.We want everyone safe and well as we come back together to finish the semester. If I learned anything this break it was that infectious diseases do not always cooperate with our best laid plans.And while this break may have not been what we had hoped, Sunday morning means it is time to roll up my sleeves and go back to work. I enjoy the process of composingYo La Tengo and find it comforting to see the week(s) ahead and know what needs to be done. I look over the upper school calendar for the coming week and organize my personal and professional schedule. I make sure I set aside some time to complete any items that might have been overlooked during the weekend. I can approach the week with a plan of action and feel slightly more in control of the chaos. I would encourage everyone to take some time today and look ahead. Exams are a mere a fortnight away. Now would be a good time to plan for upcoming projects and essays and Hamlet recitations. There is a lot to get done in the next two weeks, so start now. Make a list, consult your calendar, and commence getting things done. We have recharged our batteries and now it is time for the final sprint.Heres to staying well and buckling down and facing the challenges ahead with focus and determination. We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone had a pleasant break and is looking forward to returning to school (virtually) on Monday. Like the good teacher I am, I waited until break to fall ill. I developed a toothache over the weekend that led to an emergency visit to the dentist on Monday. The good news is I was able to get my teeth cleaned (I missed my last appointment because of COVID). The bad news is I have a root canal scheduled for next week. The running joke in my family all week consisted of family members asking me the best time to visit the dentist and I would take the icepack off of my cheek and reply 2:30.All in all, not the best Thanksgiving I have ever had, but I did manage to use half my mouth to eat twice as much food. Even though we were only four this year, the turkey weighed in at a noble 21 pounds and there were biscuits and mashed potatoes with gravy and cornbread stuffing and both green bean and sweet potato casseroles. I think there might also have been a kale salad somewhere in the mix. Despite my discomfort, I was even managed to celebrate Pie for Breakfast Day on Friday with both pumpkin and chocolate pies, so the holiday was not a complete loss.Looking ahead, we only have three weeks until Winter Break. We will start this week in our virtual mode before returning to campus for a frenzied fortnight of learning and assessments. After much discussion, we decided to have an exam week that looks exactly like a regular week. The primary difference is that, instead of a Flex Day, Friday (12/18) will be reserved for conflicts, i.e. if a student were to have three exams scheduled on a single day they could opt to take the third exam Friday morning.Individual faculty will use Exam Week in the manner that best suits the needs of each respective class. Some may not give an exam and will carry on with classes as usual. Some may want to have a single examination for remote and on-campus learners on the same day. Some may want to examine students only when they are on campus. Some may have a final paper or project due during the exam week. We want to support the myriad pedagogical needs of the faculty while respecting the wellness needs of the students.To that endTuesday, 8 December will no longer be the last day for tests or major assignments before exam week.We will allow major assessments in both of the final weeks to spread out the work with the expectation that teachers will only give ONE major assessment per class in those two weeks.Even though this coming week is virtual, you still have some opportunities to engage with the community. Parents are invited to join us for a Q&A session on Wednesday morning via Zoom. This is a chance to check in with the administrative team and share your insights and concerns. We are also inviting students, faculty and staff members to campus for free, drive-through PCR screening event on our Upper School campus. You can learn more below in the announcements or look for an email later today from our Head of School, Michael Ulku-Steiner.Heres to finishing the year with our best work. As always, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Last weekend I talked about origin stories and how YLT (both the band and this weekly newsletter) derived their names. Did you know the band played this Friday over at Duke? Thanks to those of you who reached out to give me a heads up about the show. I doubt any of you students attended since Yo La Tengo (along with Wilco and Superchunk and Fountains of Wayne) happens to fall in a category my son likes to call Dad bands. While I did not attend on Friday, I have seen them on numerous occasions, including the last time they performed at Cats Cradle in Carrboro. I had the good fortune on that evening to attend with a friend (thanks, Will) who happens to be a close friend of the band, so before the show we were permitted to hang out in the green room. There I was introduced to Ira Kaplan as he awaited his time to go on stage. I was impressed because, even as he took the time to chat, he was working through the set list, quietly picking out the tunes he was to perform later in the evening. The band has been around since 1984, so I asked if he still prepared this way for every show. His response has stuck with me. He said, I know Im going to screw up something during the show, but it wont be for lack of practice. That level of commitment to his work, the humility to recognize the potential for errors, and his willingness to prepare for every show with the same dedication struck me as an approach worth emulating. As teachers and students and parents, we are going to make mistakes, but we will continue to put in the effort and the hard work to get it right, to present our best selves. This week, as the second quarter is up and running at full speed, take some advice from Ira Kaplan. I encourage you to take look over those report cards that went home on Friday. Talk to your parents and teachers and advisors about what your teachers had to say. Our faculty spends a great deal of time grading assessments and writing comments with the hope that you, the student, will gain a fuller understanding of your abilities and your potential. We are not being disingenuous when we say we would love to see you drop by during tutorial or before a test or prior to the due date for the final draft. We are here to help you learn. Grades and comments are just one pair of tools in our kit. Please take the time to think about what your teachers have to say. We are all part of a community that is working toward your best interests. Engage in the process. Your teachers will be using the extended tutorials this week to discuss ways to assist students. This Fridays parent conferences are all about making this experience work for you. Our work together is ongoing, and we should approach it with commitment and humility and dedication. Thank you, teachers and parents and students, for taking the time to participate in the hard work that is education. And for those who might be interested, here is a little something from Yo La Tengo, my favorite song (and the seasonally appropriate) Autumn Sweater.As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to November. I hope the extra hour of sleep last night and the beautiful sunshine this weekend have served as a tonic. After a hectic week of grades and comments and college recommendations, I took a little time on Saturday for some self-care. I spent the morning reading the new Jasper Fforde novel that the librarians were kind enough to order. Thank you, Ms. Spruill and Mrs. Harris. I spent the afternoon taking a very long walk along Morgan Creek, appreciating the beautiful weather and magnificent foliage. And Saturday night I listened to an amazing group of students and faculty rock Kenan Auditorium. The use of the fire extinguisher on Mr. Blue Sky gives me hope that there might be an instrument out there for me. Thank you In The Pocket and Rise Against Hunger for putting joy and good in the world. This is what we mean by Happy, Moral, Productive.Having recharged my emotional batteries, I am looking forward to the week ahead. November for me is all about service and duty and gratitude. We will celebrate the democratic process on Tuesday by exercising our duty as citizens to make our voices heard. If you are old enough and have not done so yet, I encourage every member of our community to vote on Tuesday. I took advantage of early voting and cast my ballot last week. It is a powerful feeling to participate in such a vital process. On Thursday we will hold our annual Veterans Day assembly. This is always a special day because it affords us an opportunity to thank those who have stepped forward to protect our country at the risk of great personal sacrifice. Thank you, Mr. Adair and your class for making this happen.This week also means that second quarter is up and running at full speed. We only have eleven days of school left before Thanksgiving break. I encourage you to take some time this weekend to look over those report cards. Talk to your parents and teachers and advisors about what they have to say. We teachers spend a great deal of time grading assessments and writing comments with the hope that you, the student, will gain a fuller understanding of your abilities and your potential. We are not being disingenuous when we say we would love to see you drop by during tutorial or before a test or prior to the due date for the final draft. We are here to help you learn. Grades and comments are just one pair of tools in our kit. Please take the time to think about what your teachers have to say. We are all part of a community that is working toward your best interests. Engage in the process. Fridays parent conferences are all about making this experience work for you. Do not sit by and let it happen without your input. Thank you teachers, parents and students for taking the time to participate in the hard work that is education. And finally, Diwali, the festival of lights takes place this week. For many in our community, this is the most important holiday of the year. It is held on the darkest night of the new moon in Autumn and celebrates the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, hope over despair. I can get behind such a celebration; it is what being an educator is all about. Here is to a week full of light and knowledge and good and hope. Happy Diwali! As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

HappyGuy Fawkes Day for those who were celebrating on Friday. Whether you remember the fifth of November or no, it was still a beautiful night to sit around the bonfire eating toffee apples. And I hope you all enjoyed the bonus hour of sleep last night. I awoke early this morning happy to spend that extra hour on a very long walk among some amazing foliage. My longer walks tend to take me to the trails around University Lake, and this morning I was lucky enough to spot a fox along with the usual deer and whistle pigs that I typically encounter. As we look at our week ahead and our Veterans Day assembly on Friday, I am reminded that almost eight score years ago Abraham Lincoln delivered what we now call the Gettysburg Address. On 19 November 1863, while the Civil War ravaged our nation, Lincoln joined others to consecrate the National Cemetery at Gettysburg. Few people remember Edward Everetts two-hour oration that preceded Lincolns more concise address. Depending on which of the five versions you peruse (I use the Bliss copy as my standard as it is on display in the Lincoln Room in the White House and is the only copy to bear Lincolns signature), Lincolns speech was shorter than most of the comments you received from your teachers last week. In only 271 words (ten sentences) Lincoln spoke simply and eloquently about the purpose of our nation and the sacrifice of the soldiers who died to preserve our values and the task that befalls all of us to safeguard democracy.Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicatewe can not consecratewe can not hallowthis ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.As I was contemplating the month of November and our upcoming assembly I kept coming back to Lincolns speech about service and sacrifice and citizenship and duty and gratitudeall themes we will touch upon this month. On Friday, Mr. Adairs Literary and Artistic Response to War students will lead our annual recognition of Veterans Day. Also this week, we will use our class meeting times to kick off our RAISE Gratitude Project. And just over the horizon we will celebrate the most American of holidays, Thanksgiving. We will have lots of conversations in advisory and morning meetings about the duties and privileges that accompany being part of something bigger than ourselves. I encourage you to take a moment and reflect on Lincolns address and the obligation it bequeaths. Citizenship is a gift that comes with responsibility, and it is important that we recognize those who sacrificed so much to keep our country whole in the face of those who would divide us.Until then, there are lots of announcements below, and you have an opportunity on Saturday to hear our amazing jazz/rock combo In the Pocket. I know for a fact that Wings Live and Let Die has been part of the practice rotation, and I am looking forward to the DA interpretation of Sir Paul McCartneys second best song.Heres to celebrating our blessings and demonstrating gratitude to all those who make those blessings possible. We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

As we enter this second week of November, I find myself reflecting on Veterans Day and am reminded that almost eight score years ago Abraham Lincoln delivered what we now call the Gettysburg Address. On 19 November 1863, while the Civil War ravaged our nation, Lincoln joined others to consecrate the National Cemetery at Gettysburg. Few people remember Edward Everetts two-hour oration that precededLincolns more concise address. Depending on which of the five versions you peruse (I use the Bliss copy as my standard. It is on display in theLincolnRoom in the White House and is the only copy to bearLincolns signature),Lincolns speech was shorter than most of the comments you received from your teachers on Friday. In only 272 words (ten sentences) Lincoln spoke simply and eloquently about the purpose of our nation and the sacrifice of the soldiers who died to preserve our values and the duty that befalls all of us to safeguard democracy. It was President Lincolns hopethat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.It is my hope that you all can take some time this week to acknowledge Veterans Day and thank someone for their service. I always spend time on this day recalling my grandfather,ClaudeWilson, who lost a foot to a land mine in the Ardennes Forest and concluded WWII as a prisoner in a German POW camp. He left behind three kids and a wife in Durhamto go fight Nazis who were committing atrocities in Europe. I am grateful for his service and his sacrifice and his character. He always claimed he was lucky because, though he lost a limb, he was able to return home and see his children and grandchildren grow up. He meant a great deal to me, so much so that I named my own son,Claude, after him. I hope I, as an individual, and we, as a country, can live up to the standards so many of our fellow countrymen sacrificed so much to protect. On Veterans Day we should remember the cost to those who served. We should remember those soldiers who gave their lives fighting against foes that waved flags with swastikas or emblems of the confederacy. We should remember those who sacrificed their lives to preserve the promise of our nation. To all those who servedthank you and we remember.Remembering my grandfather also calls to mind another speech by President Lincoln: his second inaugural address delivered while the country was still in the midst of the Civil War. I am reminded of this speech because it is the source of the motto for the Veterans Administration, words I saw every time I visited the VA Hospital with my grandfather: With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan ~ to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.Lets make the most of the week ahead. We will remember those who have sacrificed for our country and democracy, we will seek to bind up the nations wounds, and, of course, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

As you prepare for exam week, please take a moment to acknowledgeChanukah. The eight-day festival of lights began at sunset on Thursday. According to Rabbi Zalman Bluming,Chanukah is a time for celebrating the light in our life. It is about brightening this world with acts of goodness and kindness. As the days become shorter and the nights grow a little colder and the world seems a little more chaotic, we all need to do our part to help brighten the world. My suggestion: just find your joy and share it with others, whether through music or dance or sport or service.Last week our advisories did just that, wrapping gifts for Durham families that were then delivered to Durham Social Services by Mr. William Edwards and Mr. Mike Meyer. Thank you to all the families that helped make this possible with your contributions and your time and your support. Even as we face the challenges imposed on us by the pandemic, it is heartening to know that our DA family can still come together to maintain traditions and share our holiday spirit with our fellow members of the Durham community.All of this talk about hope should inspire us all. Even the solar system seems to want to send a message. In the midst of the darkest day of the year, the planets can align to create a bright spot in the gloom. In fact, next week, on our shortest day of the year (12/21/20), Jupiter and Saturn will appear closer together in the night sky than they have in 800 years. This conjunction of the two planets will form what some astronomers call a Christmas Star: a fitting symbol of hope and promise.As we turn the corner on 2020 and look ahead to next year, I see so much to be hopeful about. Vaccines offer a promise of a return to normalcyto hallways that run both directions and hugs with friends and classrooms full of students eager to learn. And though we are still in the midst of winter and there are plenty of cold, dark days ahead, we will hold on to our hope. We will light our candles and decorate our houses with evergreens and lights and help brighten the world with our joy and our good will.Heres to finishing the year with our best work. As always, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Not much to say about the week ahead. You have put in the hard work since August, so face your exams with confidence. Keep at it all week. Review your study schedule today and use tomorrow to speak with your teachers. Youve got this. Once Friday rolls around you will have a nice long stretch to rest, relax and recuperate.Classes end at noon on Monday, but your teachers will be available for last minute exam questions until 3:15 pm. Please take advantage of this time to clear up any confusion about subject matter or exam protocol. Teachers will also be around most mornings during exam week (when they are not proctoring) if you have questions. As we do every year, Parents Council will have exam snacks in Kirby on the first three days of exams (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday). Stop by the concession stand and fuel up between exams. The gym and weight room will also be open between exams for those who need a little break from the mental exertion.Now exam week is not your typical week, but the rules still apply. Whether you have a morning or an afternoon exam, you need not arrive on campus until it is time for your exam. Once you arrive on campus, however, the rules about leaving campus apply. If you have completed your morning exam and do not have an afternoon exam, you may choose to sign out and leave campus. You may not, however, return prior to the end of the school day. Simply put, non-seniors are not allowed to run off campus for lunch. Only seniors may sign out and return to campus between exams.And finally, for those who need a little break or a little motivation, here is an inspirational video. Stay focused this week. Stay well. We will all exit this moving sidewalk on Friday.As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

This will be the last YLT for 2018. Thank goodness all that snow did not cause us to have to delay our exams. I would hate to disappoint you all by missing this important holiday ritual. We at Chez Wilson are looking forward to making it to Winter Break. We spent Saturday preparing for the season by picking out a fat Fraser fir to squeeze into the family room. Last night we made homemade pizza (anchovies, please!) and played seasonal music and decorated this arboreal monster. We then settled down to sip cocoa and watch all the Christmas episodes of The Office. tis the season As far as school goes, you have one reading day before exams start. I hope you have been planning ahead, spacing your studying and are ready to approach the week with confidence. I am certain you will do well. Classes end at noon on Monday, but your teachers will be available for last minute exam questions until 3:15 pm. Please take advantage of this time to clear up any confusion about subject matter or exam protocol. Teachers will also be around most mornings during exam week (when they are not proctoring) if you have questions. As we do every year, Parents Council will have exam snacks in Kirby on the first three days of exams (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday). Stop by the concession stand and fuel up between exams. Just so we are all working from the same playbookthe off-campus rules still apply during the reading day and exam days. There can be some confusion circulating about non-seniors leaving campus during these days. As always, when I am confused, I consult the All School Student-Parent Handbook, a source of wisdom and comfort, now a google doc conveniently located on Veracross. Here is the portion concerning off-campus privileges: Underclass students will not be permitted to leave campus during the school day except for urgent reasons such as medical appointments...If underclass students have fulfilled their last academic commitment for the day, they may leave campus; however, they may not return prior to the end of the school day and they must sign the student sign-out sheet in the front office. Now exam week is not your typical week, but the rules still apply. Whether you have a morning or an afternoon exam, you need not arrive on campus until it is time for your exam. Once you arrive on campus, however, the rules about leaving campus apply. If you have completed your morning exam and do not have an afternoon exam, you may choose to sign out and leave campus. You may not, however, return prior to the end of the school day. Simply put, non-seniors are not allowed to run off campus for lunch. Doing so will result in a slew of consequences ranging from Saturday detention, loss of privileges, and/or coal in your stocking. Also, failure to sign out could result in a standard morning detention. Stay focused and stay on campus. Good luck with your exams. Get lots of sleep. Take care of yourselves. Make good choices. This is the week to give your all.Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

As you prepare for the weeks ahead, please take a moment to acknowledge Chanukah. The eight-day festival of light, begins at dusk today. According to Rabbi Zalman Bluming,Chanukah is a time for celebrating the light in our life. It is about brightening this world with acts of goodness and kindness. As the days become shorter and the nights grow a little colder and the world seems a little more chaotic, we all need to step up and help brighten the world. My suggestion: just find your joy and share it with others, whether through music or dance or sport or service. It is the season of spreading joy, and Fridays special schedule will allow all of us to share our holiday spirit with our friends and neighbors in the Durham community. You also have another opportunity on Saturday to spread joy with the UMD club (see announcements below). Opportunities abound for acts of goodness and kindness; seek them out and make the world a brighter place and yourself a bit happier.Also this week, my AP Psychology class continues our unit on Learning and Memory. We have studied the differences between Classical (Pavlov making dogs salivate with bells) and Operant (Skinner teaching pigeons to play ping pong) conditioning and watched a compelling example of classical conditioning called Mr. Wilsons cats. (Mintythecat1234 calls it the "hidden gem of scientific learning on the inter webs.) We continue this week with observational learning and the dangers of punching bobo dolls when children are watching. This week we will also be moving on to memory, so I wanted to share with everyone some pertinent information about learning and memory as we start the countdown to exams. Memory consist of three parts: encoding (getting information into the memory system of your brain), storage (retaining said information in an accessible place in your brain) and retrieval (getting information out of your brain and onto the exam). If you want to successfully retrieve information, you must first learn how to properly encode and store information. The letter S appears thrice in the word success, and the following three items will prove vital to your exam SucceSS:Semantics: We process memories at different levels, and the deeper we process the better our long term retention. Deep processing encodes semantically (based on meaning); we can read and hear information, but processing information deeply requires understanding meaning. This is why tutorial is so vital to our schedule. If you really want to successfully encode information you must understand it first. If something is unclear, talk to you teacher, have them explain it, and you will find your retention will increase. To provide time for this, we will have extended tutorials on the days leading up to exams and a full afternoon on the Monday before exams start to check in with your teachers.Spacing Effect: Cramming (what scientist call massed study) does not work. It can help in the short term, but spacing out your studying (distributed study) leads to better long-term retention. This is why planning ahead is so vital. I have included the calendar for the next three weeks so you can create a schedule that will allow you to study some every night. Do not wait until the night before your exam to prepare. A little study every day will lead to improved retention.Sleep: Sleep allows us to consolidate our memories. When we are in deep sleep, the hippocampus processes memories for later retrieval. The hippocampus will replay the learned material during sleep as it transfers memories into long term storage in the cerebral cortex. Sleep needs to be a vital part of your study schedule.There you have it. The three Ss for exam SucceSS. Check out the schedule belowit takes us all the way to Winter break. Plan your study schedule now. Arrange to meet with your teachers. Get some sleep. Stay focused. Stay well. As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

It must be December because despite the 75 degree weather, every other song on the radio is about Christmas and my wife has started to make cookies. Classic toll house, Mexican wedding, salted white chocolate oatmeal, gingerbread humanoids, something calledpfeffernssethe list goes on. She says she plans on making a dozen or so different cookies for the holidays. I, of course, am her taste tester and dish washer. I am not certain who is enabling whom, but it works for us.Baking is the way she deals with the end of a tough semester. It is her release valve. What I see as a great deal of work, she sees as a source of joy and relaxation. That I understand. We all need to find our joy. As we work our way through the challenging fortnight ahead, please take time to intentionally embrace things that you love. (And, yes, I split an infinitive, but I did so because intentionality is important.). Over the next two weeks I will pause from a busy schedule to attend a few basketball games or visit my son for Sunday dinner or watch the season finale ofDoctor Who. I will eat cookies and drink copious amounts of buttermilk as I grade final projects and look ahead to the new year. Work hard, find your joy, take time to embrace the light in the world.Speaking of which, Chanukah, the eightday festival of light, wraps up this week. According to Rabbi Zalman Bluming,Chanukah is a time for celebrating the light in our life. It is about brightening this world with acts of goodness and kindness. As the days become shorter (a certainty) and the nights grow a little colder (perhaps) and the world seems a little more chaotic (likely), we all need to step up and help brighten the world. On Friday as a school, our advisories did just that, writing cards and wrapping gifts for Durham families that were then delivered to Durham Social Services by Mr. William Edwards and Mr. Mike Meyer.Thanks to all who helped make these acts of kindness happen. Looking ahead I suggest you just find your joy and share it with others. Me,I like food and music, so to celebrate I will indulge in somelatkes andsufganiot along with my wifes holiday cookies and continue to make and share playlists with friends and family and maybe even take in a live show next weekend.This weeks installment ofYLTtakes us to the end of the semester, so planning ahead isextremelyimportant at this point in the semester. The schedule for the final week is a little unusual in order to accommodate those faculty member offering exams and other final assessments, so I have laid out the full schedule for the final week below. I have also attached Mrs. Rogers patentedExam Planning Worksheet for those who have exams. I highlyrecommend giving it a spin. Good luck in the fortnight ahead. Heres to staying well and buckling down, facing the challenges ahead with focus and determination and joy. We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope your week of virtual learning has helped bridge the gap from our Thanksgiving break to the busy fortnight that sits before us. As we plan our return to school this week, it remains vitally important that we renew our commitment to safety on campus. We have been both diligent and fortunate this year with our efforts to prevent transmission at DA, and we remain dedicated to keeping our campus open while keeping everyone as safe as possible. To that end, please take a moment to review our prevention and protection protocols. COVID-19 Addendum to All-School HandbookI want to remind everyone of three important points:Please keep your student home if they are exhibiting signs or have symptoms of illness.Students must bring their own food and snacks. Shared meals, snacks, hot lunches, food trucks or food delivered to campus are not permitted.Campus access is restricted to essential personnel and groups or individuals approved by the Administrative Team. This means that parents must remain in their cars (except those assisting with temperature checks).Thank you for supporting these efforts. The 20202021 school year continues to require patience, flexibility, understanding and collaboration as we continue our commitment to academic excellence under circumstances that are difficult to predict.Academically speaking, I hope you are all well and ready for this last week of classes before exam week. We only have a fortnight before Winter Break, but before we can settle in to roasting chestnuts and donning ugly sweaters, we have a bit more work to do. The next two weeks will be full of major assignments. With that in mind, I thought I would share my annual reminder about proper study techniques. What I call the three Ss for exam weekSucceSS.Memory consist of three parts:encoding(getting information into the memory system of your brain),storage(retaining said information in an accessible place in your brain) andretrieval(getting information out of your brain and onto the exam). If you want to successfully retrieve information, you must first learn how to properly encode and store information. The letter S appears thrice in the word success, and the following three items will prove vital to your examSucceSS:Semantics: We process memories at different levels, and the deeper we process the better our long-term retention. Deep processing encodes semantically (based on meaning); we can read and hear information, but processing information deeply requires understanding meaning. This is why tutorial is so vital to our schedule. If you really want to successfully encode information you must understand it first. If something is unclear, talk to you teacher, have them explain it, and you will find your retention will increase. To provide time for this, we will have some extended tutorials leading up to exams and a full afternoon on the Monday before exams start to check in with your teachers.Spacing Effect: Cramming (what scientist call massed study)doesnotwork. It can help in the short term, but spacing out your studying (distributed study) leads to better long-term retention. This is why planning ahead is so vital. I have included the calendar for the coming weeks so you can create a schedule that will allow you to study some every night. Do not wait until the night before your exam to prepare. A little study every day will lead to improved retention.Sleep: Sleep allows us to consolidate our memories. When we are in deep sleep, the hippocampus processes memories for later retrieval. The hippocampus will replay the learned material during sleep as it transfers memories into long term storage in the cerebral cortex. Sleep needs to be a vital part of your study schedule.There you have it. The three Ss for exam weekSucceSS. Check out the schedule belowit takes us all the way to Winter break. Plan your school work schedule now. Arrange that Teams chat with your teacher. Get some sleep.Heres to finishing the year with our best work. As always, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are all well and ready for this last week of classes before exam week (cue dramatic music). We hare at chez Wilson spent the morning wrestling a giant tree into our house and now I am covered in sap and taking wagers on which cat will cause the most damage to our decorations this year. Tis the season. But before we can settle in to roasting chestnuts and donning ugly sweaters, we have a bit more work to do. Monday is the last day for major assignments (with a couple of D period exceptions), and the rest of the week will be about getting ready for your final assessments for 2019. With that in mind, I thought I would share my annual reminder about proper study techniques.

Snow days are the best! We will have to wait and see what Monday holds in terms of cancellations (we hope to have an announcement by 5:00 pm), but there is no denying the magic and the majesty of last nights snow. J.B. Priestly, a writer and social commentator from the last century whom I admire, gets at the special energy of thesnow day: "The first fall of snow is not only an event, it is a magical event. You go to bed in one kind of a world and wake up in another quite different, and if this is not enchantment then where is it to be found? Sunday morning offered a landscape full of enchantment. My daughter and her friends are somewhere out in this transformed world sledding and making snowmen and hoping with all their hearts that school is closed tomorrow.I am also hopeful because one of our neighbors has a very special traditionshe makeshomemade doughnutson the firstsnow daythen has the girls deliver them. This morning I am sipping coffee, writing YLT, watching the snow fall and awaiting my hot doughnuts. Like Pavlovs dogs, I am have been classically conditioned to salivate at the first snowfall. As I have written before,snow days, for me, recall Bill Wattersons final Calvin and Hobbes strip. I share it here so you too can see the world as brand new, as full of possibilities, as magical.Whatever tomorrow holds, know that today is full of possibilities. As you appreciate the snow fall, do not forget to set some time aside for exam prep. Monday is technically the last day for major assignments, but that date is now set for the day we return to school (whatever day that will be). I have also taken the precautionary step of moving our Morning Meeting to Wednesday should school be cancelled for tomorrow. If there is no school on Monday, please see this gift from nature as an opportunity to rest, to study, to destress and to prepare your body and mind for the assessments ahead. Its a magical world out there. Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you enjoyed our false Spring last week and took a moment (or two or three) to appreciate the newly arrived daffodils and flowering trees. I love these early suggestions of color in a bleak winter landscape. After a day spent out of doors, I concluded my day watching one of my favorite documentaries from last summer, Wont You Be My Neighbor, for the third time. It was made available this week on HBO, so I spent my Saturday night (after watching Duke shoot the lights out in Charlottesville) basking in the wisdom of someone who profoundly shaped my life. My earliest teacher (and style icon) was Fred McFeely Rogers (thats Mr. Rogers to you). He was an ordained Presbyterian minister, who saw that children of my generation were destined to waste countless hours of our precious childhood staring at the idiot box, so he turned his gentle ways to television to teach children to imagine and be kind and make the most of a beautiful day. His show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood debuted when I was three (1968 if you must now) and ran for 895 episodes. I eventually grew too cool for Mr. Rogers, preferring MAD magazine, but I now realize how formative Fred Rogers was in my life. Every day I drink my coffee out of a mug that is covered in his quotesDid you know that when you wonder, youre learning? So true.I think Ill make a snappy new day. A great lesson in cognitive psychology.And my favoriteYou can NEVER go down the drain. So from a literal perspectivebathe regularlymetaphoricallydo not be afraid to take chances.He knows that childhood is full of wonder and magic and fear, but adults are too busy or too bored to recognize the strangebeauty they experienced when they were younger. Being an adult is sometimes like that. It can be very hard to remember just how confusing it was to be a kid navigating through a world of mystery and discovery. Another favorite childhood novel catches this notion perfectly. InRamona the Pest, thesecond of Beverly Clearys wonderful novels about childhood, Ramona experiences the strangeness that is the first day of school. Despite her excitement and eagerness, Ramona continually misunderstands the teachers instruction. This begins with her first encounter with her new teacher, Miss Binney, when Ramona asks where she should sitSit here for the present, she said with a smile.A present! Thought Ramona, and knew at once she was going to like Miss Binney.Ramona spends the rest of the first day of school waiting for a present from her teacher, a present that never materializes. She handles her disappointment well. I, on the other hand, did not fare so well on the first day of school. My teacher mistakenly gave me the wrong number for the bus home. After riding all over east Durham and never seeing anything close to my home I returned to school on the bus. I mached back to the teacher and told her she was a horrible person for lying to children andI would never believe anything that came out of her mouth. I then fled her room but was eventually caught (despite my attempts to hide in a janitors closet) and ultimately brought home by the principal. Thus began my career in education. The fictional Ramona handled her confusion much better than little Rusty. But adults like Fred Rogers and Beverly Cleary help us all remember our own experiences of what it was like to be a child. And having someone remind us of that time when we were still learning the ropes of life proves invaluable precisely because those reminders reveal that perspective and empathy are foundational values for any set of moral principles. So as an adultI may be unable to see the world with the same wonder and confusion thatI experienced as a child, butI can learn to respect and appreciate the perspective of another. I can empathize with the confusion. AndI can remember thatI too was a child once.And that appreciation for an others perspective goes beyond childhood. We all come from different places and backgrounds, and we will sometimes see the world very differently, but we must learn to approach these differences by leading with openness and empathy and respect. We have so much to learn from one another. That is why a community of diverse learners with varied perspectives on life is invaluable to broadening our understanding of ourselves and the world. We can all learn so much from one another if we prioritize listening over judging.As Mr. Rogers would say, "As human beings, our job in life is to help people realize how rare and valuable each one of us really is, that each of us has something that no one else has  or ever will have  something inside that is unique to all time."And if you have any doubts about how to succeed"There are three ways to ultimate success. The first way is to be kind. The second way is to be kind. The third way is to be kind."Thank you, Fred Rogers.As always Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

This week I am looking forward to one of my favorite holidaysAnna Howard ShawDay! Shaw was born on February 14, 1847 in England and immigrated to America with her family when she was four years old. Though her early life was full of struggles and loss, she went on to become a physician and one of the first ordained femaleMethodistministers in theUnited States, and she remained a tireless activist for womens rights. She saw an injustice and chose to spend her life working to change her world.  Anna Howard Shaw was born one year before the famous Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 where Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott and other forward-thinking women gathered "to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of woman." Shaw died in 1919, one year before the 19th amendment proclaimed that the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Anna Howard Shaw never saw her dream realized, but her unflagging work made her dream possible for others. Thats Anna Howard Shaw just to the right of Susan B. Anthony!In Shaws own words: "The idealists dream and the dream is told, and the practical men listen and ponder and bring back the truth and apply it to human life, and progress and growth and higher human ideals come into being and so the world moves ever on." I am one of those practical men who listens and ponders and seeks to bring truth to human life, but I remain ever grateful to those idealists and dreamers who imagine a better world then spend a lifetime working to see their dreams come true. Thank you, Anna Howard Shaw. (and thank you, North Carolina, for finally ratifying the 19th Amendment in 1971.)You will have lots of opportunities in the coming weeks to dream and to be practical. I encourage you to sign up for the Spring Seminar, volunteer at the blood drive, help PORCH club feed the hungry, dance like no one is watching on Saturday night or discover what it is like to fly for the first time at our winter musical. Progressgrowthhuman idealsthus the world moves ever on.Lets do this together laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to the last Sunday of the 2021 school year and therefore the last Yo La Tengo for the year. I hope the weekend has treated you well. I am pleased to have both my children (young adults is probably a more accurate term) home for the holidays. We celebrated their arrival yesterday with a Tex-Mex feast with lots of guacamole and queso and chips. Followed of course by a wide variety of Christmas cookies. Later this afternoon we plan to drive over to the Christmas tree lot and share our varied arboreal expertise as we attempt to choose the perfect tree. Height, symmetry, girth, freshness all will be assessed and ranked until we agree to share our living space with a tree that always seems a great deal larger when it moves from outdoors to indoors.Introducing a tree to ones home is such an odd tradition, but it has been a staple of every Christmas of my life. And for the majority of my adult life, I have always associated our Christmas tree with the Old English epic, Beowulf. At some point during our tree buying I will invariably point out to my family in my pedantic Dad voice that in pre-Christian cultures (the Druids and the Vikings), evergreens (pines and firs and even mistletoe) were symbols of hope in the midst of winter. In Northern European cultures, on the shortest day of the year, in the midst of the dark and the cold, as communities settled in to survive a long winter, these plants that stayed fresh and green all year reminded folks of the promise of spring, a symbol of hope in a winter of discontent.The connection to Beowulf takes a little longer to explain, and by that point we have usually selected a tree, so I have to wait until we are decorating the tree to continue my tedious remarks. You see, Beowulf is a pagan story told by a Christian poet seeking to connect certain key concepts of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon values. And chief among these is the notion of grace, a favor bestowed by one who need not do so. So throughout the story of Beowulf we learn of good kings who care for their followers by sharing their protection and redistributing the treasures won in battle. Surviving a Nordic winter is a matter of effort (Beowulf defeats Grendel with his strength) but also grace (Beowulf defeats Grendels mother with a sword that he discovers just as he is about to be defeated). The poet suggests that human effort can only take you so far but some battles require the assistance of forces greater than our individual selves. Success often relies on the grace of others.Whether you celebrate Christmas or just appreciate the time spent with family away from work and school, I encourage you to embrace the concepts of hope and grace. As we approach the last week of classes please know that you are not facing the challenges of the world alone. Your teachers, your advisors, your families, your peers are here to support and encourage you to becoming your best selves. We will even have therapy dogs on campus, so please take a break and come get some puppy love to help reduce any stress or anxiety you might be experiencing during the final push towards winter break and the end of the semester. Please reach out if you need help, academic or emotional. Please extend grace to those around you. There is nothing wrong with practicing love and kindness as we all struggle with lifes vicissitudes.Christmas represents a light in the darkness, life in the prospect of death, hope in the face of lifes challenges and grace for all of us who need love and support. Merry Christmas to those who celebrate and best wishes for the coming year to everyone.Good luck in this last week. Heres to staying well and facing the challenges ahead with hope and determination and love and grace. We will continue to stay home when we are sick, wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

What a busy time of year here at Durham Academy. One of the amazing things about working with young people in a school environment is the opportunity to see such a wide array of talents on display. This weekend was full of young people excelling at debate and basketball and robotics and musical theatre and academics and so much more. Our students never stop achieving.Members of the debate team were up at Yale this weekend racking up another amazing collection of awards. I spent six years in New Haven, and I look forward to their return so we can debate the age old argument that surrounds Americas fourth oldest institution of higher learning: who has the best apizza (and yes that is spelled correctly): Pepes, Sallys or Modern. I have some strong opinions on the subject and look forward to a full-throated exploration of the matter.Closer to home, our robotics team (The DARC SIDE) was moving furniture around in the LC to simulate deep space in order to test their latest robot in anticipation of this years competition. Having made Internationals in both of the first two years of official competition, the pressure is on. Hopefully we will get a peek at the bot before they take their show on the road. Go 6502!On the athletic side of things, our girls basketball team lost a battle to Ravenscroft in Raleigh. Saturdays game was a back and forth affair for most of the first half, but the Ravens edged ahead in the second half to win 49-38. Eighth grader Joelle Davis led the Cavs with 19 points, so despite the loss, the future looks bright and I expect we will pluck the Ravens next year. Meanwhile, in Kirby Gym, the DA boys handily defeated Ravenscroft 75-50 and advanced to their first final four in 13 seasons. Freshman MJ Rice had 21, senior Bryant Randleman added 19 and sophomore Cole Sinclair posted 16, delivering a decisive Nevermore! to the Ravens. You can check out the action here. The season continues next Friday night at 8 pm at Ravenscroft against Greensboro Day in the state semis. Go Cavs!And in Kenan, the finishing touches are being put on the set and the final lines are being run for this years musical, Merrily We Roll Along. We will get a sneak peak at Mondays Morning Meeting, and the run starts on Thursday. Over 60 students are involved as cast, crew and pit band, so set your calendars now so you can catch a great show and support your friends.As all of this unfolds, we continue to have classes and prepare for next year with a preview of our course catalog during class meetings this week. We have several new course offerings next year so pay attention to Mr. Regnerus. Also keep in mind that Friday is a half-day. Students will be dismissed at noon to allow advisors to spend the afternoon discussing every student they advise with every teacher. It is a complicated and involved process, but it is all about creating individualized opportunities for our students.Ohand Carolina plays at Duke on Wednesday. I hold a degree from both institutions, and I will happily share my opinions about which team is the better of the two. Basketball and apizza are two of my favorite things, so feel free to ask me about either subject this week if you wish to be enlightened.As alwaysLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Last week was a tough one.On Wednesday, we all arrived at school to see the flags flying at half-mast once again because on Tuesday, a gunman had opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Before it was all over, seventeen students and faculty were dead. The events from Florida filled our news feeds on Wednesday. The headlines asked, once again, Another School Shooting in America: How Did This Happen? In response, we keep the victims and their families in our thoughts and prayers, we reexamine our own security measures, but deep down there are feelings of helplessness and fear and frustration. We search for answers, for understanding, and too often they are not to be found. We are left helpless and angry and afraid. This is how terrorism works.After the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub, then Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, offered this advice: "We stand with you to say that the good in this world far outweighs the evil, that our common humanity transcends our differences, and that our most effective response to terror and to hatred is compassion, it's unity, and it's love." Now is the time for us to embrace the good, to cultivate compassion and unity and lovenow is the time to be our best selves.Back in October I shared the following after the shooting in Las Vegas:As I thought about this feeling of being afraid, I was reminded of an episode ofDoctor Who(yes, I am a bit of a nerd) called Listen. In the episode, the Doctor speaks to a child who is afraid of the thing under the bed, that uneasy feeling that we all experience that we are not alone at night. The Doctor speaks to that fear, by explaining how fear activates our sympathetic nervous systemLet me tell you about scared. Your heart is beating so hard, I can feel it through your hands. So much blood and oxygen pumping through yourbrain, it's like rocket fuel. Right now, you can run faster and you can fight harder, you can jump higher than ever in your life. And you are so alert, it's like you can slow down time. What's wrong with scared? Scared is a super power. It's your super power.I have always been impressed by that ideafear is a super power. As I was teaching my Psychology class about the nervous system I was reminded of this phrase. Fear allows us to outrun the bear, to speak from our hearts before the entire school, to stand up to bullies, to find the courage to do the right thing. Fear can shut us down, but it can also motivate.Clara, the Doctors companion, echoes the Doctors advice later in the episode when she speaks to a young version of the Doctor (time travel can get messy). Her reframing of the advice gets at the heart of the matter"Listen," she tells the young Doctor. "I know you're afraid. Being afraid is all right. Because didn't anyone ever tell you? Fear is a super power. Fear can make you faster and cleverer and stronger. And one day, you're gonna come back to this barn, and on that day, you're going to be very afraid indeed. But that's okay because if you're verywiseand very strong, fear doesn't have to make you cruel or cowardly. Fear can make you kind." When we talk about our mission at Durham Academy, this is what we mean. We want you to graduate from this place wise and strong and kindready to face a world that can be scary at times.As we move forward in the face of tragedy, lets do so with purpose. Lets remember the good in the world, and lets celebrate those who bring hope to our community by promoting empathy, kindness, integrity, responsibility and courage. Let us recognize those who embody curiosity, engagement, authenticity, joy and balance. Let us acknowledge our community members who exemplify creativity, drive, resilience, generosity and wisdom. I encourage you to read more about The Durham Academy Graduate: A Mission-Driven Life. I share this reminder of our communitys values because just over the horizon of the fortnight schedule below sits the Magnificent Community Assembly. This celebration of our community and its values will be held on Wednesday, 7 March during a special day of programming. Please sendmeyour nominations for students, faculty or staff that best embody these values. Carve out the time to write a short paragraph that recognizes a student or adult that has done something to honor these principles. You need not write anything fancy, just something that captures what you have seen. The very act of writing it will make you feel betterI promise. There is so much good in our community; lets shine the spotlight on it.To facilitate this process, we will have a bit of a special schedule this week. Sophs will have class meeting on Tuesday, Froshes on Wednesday and Juniors on Thursday to discuss next years course offerings. When not in class meeting, others will be holding advisory. Please use advisory time this week to support one another and think of nominees for our Magnificent Community Assembly. This occasion is one where we come together to honor what is best about our community. Your participation is vital. Enjoy the beautiful weather today. Get your homework done. Tell someone close to you that you love them. We only get so many days; each one deserves to be celebrated.Lets do our best to take care of one another laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you all have been able to appreciate the beautiful sunshine this weekend. Sunny days can, in fact, sweep both the physical and the emotional clouds away. Fortunately, the weather continues to look Spring-like for the week ahead. Punxsutawney Pete, that shamanic rodent form Pennsylvania, made his prediction a fortnight back that Spring would arrive late this year. However, the fact that he has only been right 4 of the last 10years (which by the way is consistent with his39% lifetime accuracy), suggests the odds are in our favor for an early Spring. Whatever the remainder of Winter holds in store, Spring will pay us a visit this week (Spring showers on Monday give usher in mid-sixties and sunny on Tuesday). Take advantage of this gift and get outside to absorb some vitamin D and stave off the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Take a walk along Sandy Creek and listen to the frogs singing,each to each, and look for the daffodilsandforsythiathat will use the warm weather to provide some bright yellow accents to the dull brown landscape. While more cold weather might be on the way, asPercy Bysshe Shelleywrote, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?For families who are celebrating 2021 Lunar New Year, Cung h pht ti   ! If you would like to celebrate the new year, we invite you to join us for Durham Academy's virtual Lunar New Year Celebration and community gathering at 7 p.m. this evening. This event is supported by DA's Diversity, Equity & Engagement team and hosted by Upper School teachers Mr. Thomas Phu and Ms. Bonnie Wang. We recognize that this is an especially difficult year for many of our Asian/Asian American families. Many have relatives living outside the United States with whom they have not been able to visit since last February, and many are facing a rise in anti-Asian racism fueled by the global pandemic. We would like to create a way to build community and celebrate the most important festival of Asian culture together. We invite you to come share your family traditions, explore dinner recipes, learn about heritage connections, and support each other while celebrating the Year of Ox. RSVP is required.As a way of sharing some family traditions, a small group of DA families collaborated with us to capture some footage from their Chinese and Lunar New Year celebrations last week.Hereis a short (2-minute) video montage Jesse Paddock was able to arrange for us. Like a sunny day, I guarantee it will bring a smile to your face. Also, Bonnie Wang organized a group of upper school students who were willing to share a bit more about their celebrations. Theirrecording is a bit longer (8-minutes) but adds some incredible depth to the highlights captured in the first video.We hope you enjoy.Lets celebrate together this week as we continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Last week was something special. We had our one (and most likely only) Snow Day. Not enough snow to do much with, but it was a great chance to sit by the fire, drink hot cocoa and get caught up on work and life and family. I certainly appreciated it. Giving Day on Tuesday was another massive success. A big thanks to all the members of the community who pitched in and paid it forward to support the school. And though we lost a close game in Charlotte on Friday, our Varsity Boys Basketball had an amazing season that will certainly set the standard for years to come: a school record 28 wins, 8-0 TISAC conference championship, a #1 seed in the state tournament, and a 2nd straight Final Four appearance. Well done! And the cast and crew of The Addams Family certainly deserve a shout out. The weather may have delayed opening night, but the show was simply incredible. Kudos to all who helped make it happen. Just another amazing week at Durham Academy surrounded by talented, caring folks. You are all awesome.Looking ahead, I hope you are as excited as I am about Leap Day this Saturday (2/29). I hope that Leap Day William pays you a visit and exchanges all your tears for candy!What? You do not celebrate Leap Day. Why in heavens name not? The idea goes that every four years (with the exception of years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, since those years do not contain a leap day), you get a "magical extra day" to take chances and do all those things you would not normally do. You do not need to believe in Leap Day William to embrace such an opportunity. This week you should take a chance and try something new: attend that JV Tennis or AP Bio meeting or apply to teach at SOCK camp or sign up to donate blood or register to vote or write a thank you note to a teacher or advisor or share a pudding cup with your BFF or (as my daughter suggests) buy a unicorn and get ten more cats. Whatever you decide, do not let Leap Day pass without considering (and maybe even trying) something out of the ordinary. Remember: real life is for March."As we look forward to Leap Day, however, I would encourage everyone to take a moment and plan ahead for "real life." Spring break is only a fortnight away! Now would be a good time to plan for upcoming projects and essays and tests. You know how we teachers like to cram in assignments before a break. So, there is a lot to get done in the next two weeks. Start now. Make a list, consult your calendar, and commence getting things done. You will feel better for doing it. In the words of the poet Andrew Marvell, though we cannot make our sun stand still, yet we will make him run. Carpe diem, yall. Seize the Leap Day and make it yours. P.S. On Leap Day you are not allowed to poke anyone in the eye if they are not wearing blue and yellow. We will celebrate Leap Day without the barbaric rites that accompany it!And always,Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Our fortnight schedule carries us all the way to Spring Break, so please take a moment to read through the announcements. March arrives on Friday and brings with it Parent Conferences and course registrations, so spend a little time this week talking to your parents and your advisor. The course catalog is bursting with opportunities to feed your curiosity and dive deep into a subject you love. There are myriad opportunities to learn and grow and discover.As we look ahead to next years courses, we cannot forget that the Durham Academy experience is about so much more than classes and homework. Being part of a community necessitates more than tending to the needs of the self. As members of the DA community we should consistently strive to conduct ourselves in a manner that will further the mission of our school, our class, our teams, and our community. We should seek to act as responsible members of something bigger, working for the common good rather than personal advantage. We are learning to honor the rights of others by conducting ourselves honorably at all times while at DA and throughout our lives as citizens of and contributors to the larger community of the world. We will have multiple substantive opportunities this week to embody these goals. On Wednesday our 9th graders will prepare for our hosting of Special Olympics later this Spring and our sophomores and juniors will head out into the greater Durham community to engage in service learning. On Saturday In The Pocket will team up with the very talented Django Haskins to celebrate our musical gifts and raise money in support of Strongher Together, a local program for girls who may be different in a thousand ways, but who share a heart for forward progress, acceptance and most of all, each other. Committing to the greater good of our community is an essential part of what it means to be a DA student.We articulate this commitment to something more in our schools Mission, and we celebrate these aspirations annually with our Magnificent Community assembly. Curiosity, empathy, kindness, integrity, responsibility, courage, engagement, authenticity, joy, balance, creativity, drive, resilience, generosity and wisdom: I encourage you to read all about them in The Durham Academy Graduate: A Mission-Driven Life. I repeat this reminder of our communitys values because just over the horizon sits the Magnificent Community Assembly. This celebration of our community and its values will be held on Friday, 8 March during a special day of programming. I invite you to please send me your nominations for students, faculty or staff that embody any of these values. Take the time to write a short paragraph that recognizes a student or adult that has done something to honor these principles. You need not write anything fancy, just something that captures what you have seen. The very act of writing it will be its own rewardI promise. There is so much good in our community; lets celebrate one another together.Also on the near horizon, DA is hosting its third Giving Day on March 5. On this day, parents, faculty, staff, alumni, parents of alumni, grandparents and Upper School students join together to give back to Durham Academy. The goal is 1000 gifts to the DA Fund. This fund supports every teacher, every student, every day. A gift of any amount counts toward the goal, and our success is all about participation. As a member of the Durham Academy community you are part of something much bigger than yourself. Lets do our best to honor of one another and our communitylaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Only one week left until Spring Break, so lets make it a good one. March finally arrives on Monday, and while this has been a mild winter (more wet than cold), we have certainly spent more time outdoors than any year before. I find myself looking forward to Spring with its sunny mornings, longer days, and the general greening of nature. This last year has been a long and trying one for all of us, but warmer days and vaccines and hope for normalcy are in our future. Let it be Spring.And as I express my appreciation for this seasonal change, I am reminded that we could all do with a little more gratitude in our lives. Robert Emmons, the worlds leading scientific expert on gratitude, has argued in his essay, Why Gratitude Is Good, that gratitude has two key components: 1) it is an affirmation of goodnessthere are good things in the world, gifts and benefits weve received and 2) we recognize that the sources of this goodness are outside of ourselvesWe acknowledge that other peopleor even higher powers, if youre of a spiritual mindsetgave us many gifts, big and small, to help us achieve the goodness in our lives. Emmons and other researchers see the social dimension as being especially important to gratitude. Gratitude, he writes, is a relationship-strengthening emotion, because it requires us to see how weve been supported and affirmed by other people. Because gratitude encourages us not only to appreciate gifts but also pay them forward, another gratitude expert, sociologist Georg Simmel, has called it the moral memory of mankind. Gratitude, both given and received, makes our lives better.So as we look forward to a break from our daily grind and a brief respite from all the pressures of school work, I want to take a moment this week to bring gratitude to the fore and celebrate all the good things we do for one another. I am grateful to our faculty and staff who have worked tirelessly to create a school year like no other where every lesson, every class, every activity (both big and small), every event, and even lunch had to be reinvented. I am grateful to all the students who persevered through some cold/wet lunches and frustrating protocols, recognizing that being together in person meant sacrifices. I am grateful to my family for movie nights and family dinners and their immeasurable support as we all struggled to find strength and hope in the midst of a pandemic. I am grateful to the parents who volunteered to check temperatures and delivered gifts and words of encouragement. I am grateful to the higher powers (God, fate, Mr. Ulku-Steiner, science, diligence, planning and preparation) that allowed us to make it this far without a transmission on campus. We have been extraordinarily fortunate, and as our team of medical experts recommended to the administration on Wednesday, we will keep our protocols in place because they have worked well to date.And speaking of faculty that go the extra mile, this weeksadvisoryactivity is brought to you by the DA FacultyHBCUPanel. As part of our celebration of Black History Month, advisories watched videos last week and shared questions with our panel. During this weeksadvisoryactivity (please note the special schedules on Tuesday and Thursday), we will share the responses put together by the FacultyHBCUpanel. Thanks to everyone who helped make this programming possible.So this week and beyond, lets continue to show our gratitude and uplift one another as we continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope this beautiful day finds you all well. I am enjoying a little family time here in the Swannanoa Valley in western North Carolina. The weather here has been perfect for hiking (Lookout Mountain in Montreat) and eating (Hey Hey Cupcake! in Black Mountain) and unplugging (36 hours without electronics). But now it is time to break my electronic fast and return to the work at hand (57 unanswered emails!). Fortunately, the weather continues to look gorgeous for the week ahead. Punxsutawney Pete, that shamanic rodent form Pennsylvania, made his prediction yesterday that Spring would arrive early. Ignoring the fact that he has only been right 4 of the last 10 years (which by the way is consistent with his 39% lifetime accuracy), lets hope this year tips the balance toward my much more precise coin-toss prognostication (lifetime 50% accuracy). Whatever the rest of Winter holds in store, Spring will pay us a visit this week (73 and sunny on Tuesday). Take advantage of this gift and get outside to absorb some vitamin D and stave off the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Take a walk along Sandy Creek and listen to the frogs singing, each to each, and look for the daffodils and forsythia that will use the warm weather to provide some bright yellow accents to the dull brown landscape. Certainly more cold weather is on the way, but as Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?Just a gentle reminderwe do have school tomorrow with a special Day 0 schedule. All of your classes will meet. I will be heading down the mountain soon and look forward to seeing you all bright and early Monday morning. Until thenLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Greetings from the beautiful mountains of North Carolina. Dr. Mrs. DB had a birthday this weekend, so Clan Bitterman piled into the car on Friday afternoon and drove up to the Swannanoa Valley to get away and celebrate. My wife likes Mexican food and coconut cake, and two of her favorite places for those are in Asheville. We hiked in the cold, we relaxed and read by the fire, we ate cupcakes, we just spent time together as a family. Pretty much a perfect weekend. I hope yours was equally satisfying and that you make the most of your day off tomorrow. We teachers will arrive to a much quieter campus on Monday to develop professionally, discuss our curriculum and continue on our path towards creating the best educational experience we can provide. We chose this profession because we value education and much of that grows out of the fact that we are lifelong learners. I hope I never stop learning, and I could not ask for a better profession than being a teacher. All day long I see young people growing by expanding their understanding of themselves and the world around them. And every day I learn something new from my students. I read, I think, I attempt to understand others. I grow and change as a person and a teacher, and being on this journey of discovery gives my life purposeand I am happy to share this excursion with all of you. Part of this journey involves examining what we teach and how we teach. As I think about how education has changed, I am always looking for inspiration and guidance. I recently reread an essay by James Baldwin that I first discovered as a young teacher. Baldwins writing and his insight into society and education have been an inspiration to many educators, myself included. Over fifty years ago he wrote a powerful essay called, A Talk to Teachers. His words continue to ring true:The purpose of education, finally, is to create in a person the ability to look at the world for himself, to make his own decisions, to say to himself this is black or this is whiteTo ask questions of the universe, and then learn to live with those questions, is the way he achieves his own identity.This week ahead is full of learning: opportunities to ask questions that cannot always be answered, to gain the skills necessary to make some sense of the world, to discover the resilience to carry on in the face of doubt and, hopefully, to achieve your own identity. Lets do this together laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are all making the most of your long weekend. Once again we find ourselves on a cold, wet Sunday morning, looking ahead to a rainy week. February can be a trying month, but as last weeks Spirit celebration and Virtual CavDome suggest, we are capable of sparking our own joy and celebrating together. I was particularly impressed by the faculty who embraced Decades Day and looked pretty sharp on Twin Day. Ms. Caruso wins the award for best monocle substitute and Ms. Wang demonstrated that, with a few deft touches, even my drab fashion sensibility can be elevated. Thanks to our student leaders who organized the events and all the faculty and students who participated. Looking ahead to the rest of February, I would like to use this weeks YLT to amplify the message sent earlier from our student leaders in RAISE. RAISE stands for Raising Awareness for Inclusion and Social Equity. Last week we were pleased to announce that RAISE will now be an official part of our student government. Alongside the other existing committees, they will collaborate to improve the Durham Academy experience through their mission to promote inclusion throughout our community. Their message:Each year, during the month of February, we celebrate Black History Month. Black History Month was originally conceived by the historianCarter G. Woodsonas aweek-long celebration to honor the lives and work of both Frederick Douglass and President Abraham Lincoln along with the history and contributions of African-Americans over the years.The aspiration was that this brief exploration of Black history would pave the way for a more integrated educational experienceeverymonth of the year, not just in February. To this end, we want to encourage everyone in our community to help us celebrate the achievements of African Americans and their central role in U.S. history. We hope youll take the time to explore thisslide show, take part in aBlack History Month Challengeand/or attend some of our upcoming programs (time/location will be announced in upcoming emails):<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>Black History Month Art Workshop<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>African Dance Workshop<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)Panel<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>Black Families in the Media-FilmPlease, join us, support us, and partner with us to continue building something special here at Durham Academy. Also, if you have relationships, ideas, or suggestions you are willing to send our way, please reach out. As we take time this month and throughout the rest of the year to make underrepresented voices, specifically those of Black and African-American authors, scholars, artists, inventors, politicians, and humanitarians a more prominent part of the learning that happens on campus, let us also be mindful of the work that lies ahead.p.s. Follow us onInstagram!In honor of Black History Month,I would like to share some wise counsel fromFrederickDouglass. Douglass was born into slavery but recognized early in his life that "knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom. He was self-educated, he escaped slavery and he became one of the most profound orators in American history. He is a testament to the power of education and the responsibility that comes with knowledge. His words continue to ring true:If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.This week ahead will be full of learning and struggling, but we will move forward together, learning from one another and supporting one another along the way. And as always, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Only one week left until Spring Break, so lets make it a good one. March is finally here, and while this has been a mild winter (Only one snow day! Seriously?), I find myself looking forward to Spring with its sunny mornings, longer days, and the general greening of nature. I always enjoy natures transition from dull to vibrant, from harsh lines to soft forms, from quiet stillness to the full-throated singing of frogs and birds. Let it be Spring.And as I express my appreciation for this seasonal change, I am reminded that we could all do with a little more gratitude in our lives. Robert Emmons, the worlds leading scientific expert on gratitude, has argued in his essay, Why Gratitude Is Good, that gratitude has two key components: 1) it is an affirmation of goodnessthere are good things in the world, gifts and benefits weve received and 2) we recognize that the sources of this goodness are outside of ourselvesWe acknowledge that other peopleor even higher powers, if youre of a spiritual mindsetgave us many gifts, big and small, to help us achieve the goodness in our lives.

Every year, we set aside some time to celebrate our commitment to the tenets set out in our schoolsMission during ourMagnificent Communityassembly.Curiosity,empathy,kindness,integrity,responsibility,courage,engagement,authenticity,joy,balance,creativity,drive,resilience,generosityandwisdom: you can read all about them inThe Durham Academy Graduate: AMission-Driven Life. I repeat this reminder of our communitys values because as we look ahead to this Fridays assembly, I want all of us to take a moment to think about the folks who help make our daily lives just a little bit better. Fridays Magnificent Community Assembly will be a little different this year. This celebration of our community and its values will focus specifically on gratitude. More details will be revealed as this week unfolds, so stay tuned. I promise you will all head into Spring Break with a smile, feeling better about yourself, your school and the wonderful people you are surrounded by at Durham Academy.Until thenLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Or should I say afternoon? This whole springing forwards an hour has left me with a bit of temporal confusion. Combine that with a week spent away from my computer and you have the makings of a bit of mental foggery. I did my best over the course of the last week to put away the screens and inhabit an analog world. I kicked off my break last Monday by making the short drive down to Pittsboro to Circle City Books & Music to fill in the gaps of my Horatio Hornblower collection and pick up a few albums on vinyl. I then proceeded to spend much of the break blockading the roadstead at Brest, confounding the machinations of Bonaparte and trying to remember the difference between the fore topmast staysail and the main top-gallant sailall from the comfort of a comfy chair in a sunny spot. My family laughs at my fondness for these sea-going novels because they have witnessed on innumerable occasions my proclivity for sea sickness. My one sailing adventure (on the Chesapeake Bay) ended ignominiously with my being set ashore mid trip on a jetty miles from our destination because I was undone by the combination of wind and wave. I am very much a terrestrial creature, but I love the idea of sailing. So I read books.As the poet Emily Dickenson so aptly wrote:There is no Frigate like a BookTo take us Lands awayNor any Coursers like a PageOf prancing Poetry This Traverse may the poorest takeWithout oppress of Toll How frugal is the ChariotThat bears the Human Soul But now the real world calls, so I will sail my frigate back to Portsmouth. I will put down my books and take up my laptop and face the reality of email and Teams meetings and spreadsheets. The transition will not be easy, but I will make the most of this virtual week to modify my thinking and reset my brain to digital mode. I hope you found a way to indulge your interests over the break and are ready to return to learn. Only a mere fortnight remains in the semester, so the coming weeks will be busy. Please reset your clocks and your brains as we lean into the work aheadlike the starboard watch leaning into the capstan as they weigh anchor and commence a new voyage.So this week we will reattach our thinking caps as we ease back into learning, and even though we are remote, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

When we left school for Spring Break, we knew that things were likely to change during our time apart, and that is one of the reasons we asked you all to keep washing your hands and take home your school materials. Now that we have reached the moment where social distancing is the new normal, I imagine that the reality of all the closures and cancellations might be giving way to a sense of ominousness. I know that the news can be a bit overwhelming, but what we are doing right now is an amazing act of social solidarity. We are putting our regular lives on hold so we can give nurses, doctors and hospitals the time and space to help those who will fall ill. The sacrifices we make today will save lives tomorrow. Please know that what you are doing is noble and important; we will figure out the rest.I am sure you have lots of questions about the weeks ahead. To be honest, I do too. But what I can tell you is that your teachers are meeting and planning and are going to be ready to take this community online on Wednesday. We know there will be challenges and technical glitches, but we also know that we will rise to the occasion. We will be there for one another and we will continue to grow and learn and be our best selves. I will have more details for you on Tuesday. As we begin this period of estrangement, you should know that we are not the first to face such a moment. In 1665, the University of Cambridge temporarily closed due to the bubonic plague. A young graduate, Isaac Newton, had to return to his family farm, and he used this time in isolation to formulate infinitesimal calculus and study the nature of optics. Somewhere along the way he also started theorizing about the nature of gravity. He returned to Cambridge in 1667 with pages of notes and theories, was raised from fellow to professor in two years, and changed the world of science. Tradition also has it that William Shakespeare wrote his two long poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, during a period of forced unemployment in 159294, when an outbreak of the plague closed Londons theaters. The poems were published, respectively, in 1593 and 1594. His sonnets and another fairly lengthy poem, The Phoenix and the Turtle, are also thought to date from this time in his career. During his life, Shakespeare lost friends and family to the outbreaks: multiple siblings in his youth and his own son, Hamnet, in 1596. Because of this, Shakespeares works, particularly his sonnets, are filled with an ominous sense of Time and Loss, but they also are filled with an adamant sense of Hope and Purpose and Devotion. As we move forward, please keep the examples of Newton and Shakespeare in your mind. Even though we will be apart, please continue to learn and discover and write and love and hope. We are just an email away. Since my grasp of calculus was always tenuous at best, I will leave you with one of Shakespeares sonnets. Sonnet 60Like as the waves make towards the pebbl'd shore,So do our minutes hasten to their end;Each changing place with that which goes before,In sequent toil all forwards do contend.Nativity, once in the main of light,Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.Time doth transfix the flourish set on youthAnd delves the parallels in beauty's brow,Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope your break has been everything you had dreamed it would be. Myself, I watched more than my share of basketball. Although I was disappointed in Dukes loss in the rematch with UNC to start the break, the week ended well with the return of Zion and rightful order restored. Like Cyrus the Greats edict in the book of Ezra, Zions return was most welcome and much celebrated in our home, turning our jeremiads to joviality, our lamentations to ovations. I look forward to Duke v. UNC, Round IV in April.Fortunately, the break also afforded the opportunity to do more than watch basketball. The beautiful weather this week was perfectly Spring-like, and I was able to accomplish many items on my to-do list. Psychology tests: graded! Lawn: raked, pruned and mulched! Taxes: filled and filed! Daughters computer: repaired (after multiple agonizing visits to the Apple store). I was also able to extend my annual walk about this year to 24.92 miles along Morgan Creek and Bolin Creek and the railroad beds of Carrboro/Chapel Hill. There is nothing so restorative as the sound of moving water, physical exertion and time to ruminate upon ones place in the universe. Before we look ahead to the coming weeks, I do want to take a moment to say how proud I am of you all. The week before Spring Break showcased our community at its finest. The participation of our alums, families, faculty and staff in the Day of Giving and the shared recognition during our Magnificent Community assembly bespeak a community at its best. In the words of Aristotle (translated here for those who do not read ancient Greek): "Moral excellence comes about as a result of habit. We become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts." It is vital that we do more than talk about being Happy, Moral, Productive. We must practice and we must celebrate our peers and colleagues who walk the walk. Thank you for consistently being awesome. Generosity, gratitude and leadership are the hallmarks of a DA student. Looking ahead, the fortnight schedule below takes us to the end of the quarter. Please use the regular tutorials this week and the extended tutorials next week to make the most of the final push. (Remember: extended tutorials are just like other tutorials except they are longer. No need to check in with your advisor unless they ask you to do so.) You are recovered and rested and ready, so make the most of your time and finish the quarter with Zion-like focus and diligence and commitment. I look forward to seeing you all get your A Cappella Jam on this Friday and displaying your leadership during next weeks student presidential speeches and elections.As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope your break has been everything you had dreamed it would be. Myself, I watched more than my share of basketball. Although I was disappointed in Dukes loss in the rubber match with UNC, I hope the two teams get to meet one more time before the season comes to a close. (It would certainly benefit my bracket.) In between games, I made the drive up to Butner to have lunch at the BBQ Barn (Great Food at the Pink Pig) with Bill Harmon, my poetry professor from grad school. The barbecue was solid, but the conversation was excellent. Speaking of pork and poetry, I recommend that you check out Kevin Youngs reading of his Ode to Pork (it starts at the 3:30 mark). I had the opportunity to meet Kevin and hear him speak in October as the 2017 Thomas Wolfe lecturer at UNC. It is always good to know that good poets still exist in the world. Basketball, barbeque and poetry life is good. The snow to start the week and the weather in general were not what I would call Spring-like, but the cold snap made for a great excuse to sit by the fire and read. I finished
John Scalzis Old Mans War and am 400 pages into Vanity Fair. It has been a long while since I last read this Thackeray, but I still laugh aloud at his caustic wit. Both my wife and daughter declared that I was officially a nerd. As
the weather improved on Friday, I was able to enjoy my annual walk about23.68 miles along Morgan Creek and Bolin Creek and the railroad beds of Carrboro/Chapel Hill. There is nothing so restorative as the sound of moving water, physical exertion and time
to ruminate upon ones place in the universe. Before we look ahead, I do want to take a moment to say how proud I am of you all. The week before Spring Break showcased our student body at its finest. Your participation in the Day of Giving, the shared recognition during our Magnificent Community and the mature leadership you all displayed during Fridays walkout bespeak a community at its best. Thank you for consistently being awesome. Generosity, gratitude and leadership
are the hallmarks of a DA student.
Looking ahead, the fortnight schedule below takes us to the end of the quarter. Please use the extended tutorials this week to prepare for the final push. (Remember: extended
tutorials are just like other tutorials except they are longer. No need to check in with your advisor unless they ask you to do so.) Make the most of your free time.

I hope you are all doing well and keeping your spirits up. I know that Mr. Ulku-Steiners message on Friday was a disappointment to many of you. Whether you anticipated its content or no, the realization that we would not be seeing each other anytime soon and that our distance learning was the new normal represents a drastic change to the way many of us imagined our Spring would unfold. Last week your teachers spent countless hours transforming our classes into on-line learning communities. Your teachers deserve our sincere thanks for their heroic efforts to reimagine our courses and keep them moving forward. And as we settle in to our academic work, we also understand that class time constitutes just a small part of what defines our school. We know that seeing friends and having lunch together and playing sports or music fill our days with meaning and laughter and hope. We continue to seek ways to make those connections in the virtual world. On Saturday I sent this video to the seniors, but I am sure it will resonate with many of you. We continue to follow the news, to consult with our peer institutions and seek to follow best practices. We want to preserve what we can of our community and our traditions, but this requires a lot of creative thinking and careful planning as we move forward into uncertainty. What I can promise is that we, the members of the staff and faculty at Durham Academy are here for you. Do not hesitate to reach out to a trusted teacher, an advisor, Mrs. Frasher, Mrs. Danser or me. I will echo what I said last week: what we are doing right now is an amazing act of social solidarity. We are putting our regular lives on hold so we can give nurses, doctors and hospitals the time and space to help those who will fall ill. The sacrifices we make today will save lives tomorrow. Please know that what you are doing is noble and important. Earlier this week Mrs. Cleaver sent me a note in which she shared an observation from Rabbi Jeffrey Meyer from the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Rabbi Meyer suggested that we refer to our actions not as social distancing but rather physical distancing and social connecting. Yes, we need to physically separate ourselves, but now more than ever we need to come together for support and love and a sense of connection. In the coming days we will be working on plans to recreate those social events that define our community. Mrs. Frasher, the Lead Class Advisors and members of your student government are eager to make our school a well spring of connection and community. Stay tuned for more.And finally, looking ahead, please be both patient and candid in your communications. We are working through this new learning format, and teachers will be adjusting the course content as we discover more about our technical capacities and the ways we are using our time together. Teachers want to hear directly from students about how things are going. Also, given that this is the last week of the quarter and that we had seven of nine weeks of 3rd quarter under our belts before break, we hope to be able to offer third quarter grades for all our students. We will continue to discuss our options for fourth quarter, recognizing that our new learning environment and our current conditions will require a reassessment. We continue to meet daily as an administrative team to chart the course forward. Thank you, as always, for your patience and support.On a personal note I want to say thanks to everyone out there who is doing their best to help make things better for others. Lets continue to give where we can and ask for help when we need it. I was in the midst of a low moment on Saturday, when the right song just happened to rise to the top of my shuffle. I hope it helps you too. Johnny Cash - I Won't Back DownNow more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you all have had a great weekend. It certainly was a busy one for many of our students and faculty, with lots of Spring sports teams in action on Friday. We also had an amazing A Capella jam in Kenan, and the Darc Side is representing up in Asheville. If you are so inclined you can follow all the robot action athttps://www.twitch.tv/first_north_carolina. Amongst all the madness that is March something else very special happened on Wednesday. While many of you were going about your academic routines or completing your brackets, Spring quietly arrived at 5:58 pm. The passing of the Vernal Equinox means our days are now longer than our nights, which helps allay my nyctophobiaslightly. So, it was Saturday evening and I was sitting around the fire pit in my back yard (it was not too dark yet), listening to the frogs desperately calling for companionship, and partaking of a large, chunky glass of ice cold buttermilk, when I took up my favorite reading material, The All-School Student-Parent Handbook, to peruse its pages for strength and guidance. Thoughts of Spring directed my fancy to the dress code where I found the following wisdomFootwear must be worn at all times. Clothing that is inappropriate for school includes, but is not limited to the following:Tops that expose back, cleavage or midriffPants, shorts, skirts, etc. that expose the buttocksStrapless tops, halter tops or plunging necklinesSleeveless shirts (males)Clothing that advertises or promotes alcohol, tobacco or drugsClothing with printed messages that promote racism, sexism or any cause contrary to the mission of the schoolClothing that is sexually explicitVisible undergarments of any typeExcessively ripped or worn clothingAny other clothing that any faculty member deems inappropriateStudents found violating the dress code will be warned and might be asked to change clothes, and their parents will be notified if the issue persists. Additional violations will result in a disciplinary response. Decisions about the appropriateness of student dress are up to the discretion of the faculty.Nothing too controversial there. Just some guidelines to clarify the schools expectations. No attempt to stifle expression or co-opt your personal tastes. No judgement of your morals or your fashion sensibilities. The dress code is simply a set of standards for this community. It can seem outdated. It may seem fussy. But it is not a tool of the great oppressor. We are simply trying to delineate standards for school attire. Changes have been made based on input from our Student Advisory Board, and we will continue to refine our standards as trends and sensibilities change. But this is the code we have now.The arrival of Spring and warm weather brings a change in apparel. Please peruse the dress code and adjust your school wear accordingly. Save the tank tops and Daisy Dukes for the weekend. If the Deans or a teacher approach you, it is not to chastise but to remind, and after reminders come corrections.As always, if you would like to debate the finer points of the dress code please stop by my office. If you have questions about a particular item of clothing just ask. If you are an Autumn (like me) and eschew the pastels so common to a spring palette we can lament together. But all I really need is for you to be aware of the standards and do your best to follow them. If you miss the mark, we will let you know. Hopefully no one will need to run home to change, but that is always an option.Thanks for reading this annual reminder with patience and understanding.Now, before you commence composing your anti-dress code manifesto, please take some time to check out the announcements below. There are lots of activities and opportunities aheadinternships, clubs, contests and concertsjust to name a few. Take a chance on something new. Best of luck to our candidates on Monday and to all of you as you finish the quarter with your best efforts.As always laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

A happy Palm Sunday to you all. I hope you made the most of this weekend. Besides grading some papers for my Ethics class and prepping for my new History section, I took some

 time on Saturday to visit with some friends in Raleigh and have a big family dinner at Gourmet Kingdom in Carrboro. We ordered so much food we had to stack dishes on top of one another. Once I finish

YLT I plan on tucking into the leftovers. After lunch, I hope to have all my work done by five today so I can watch just a little more basketball. I am pulling for a Duke/Loyal-Chicago final. Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt is my new favorite sports figure.

The week ahead may be a short one, but I imagine it is a busy one for you all. Tests and projects tend to pile up as the quarter draws to a close. Plan your week carefully. Check

 in with your teachers for support. Know that you have what it takes to do well. If you need a little confidence boost I always find Mr. Rogers (style icon and pedagogical role model) does the trick. I am super excited about the film,

Wont You Be My Neighbor, coming out this summer.



I will leave you with a little advice from Mr. Rogers
Anyone who has ever been able to sustain good work has had at least one personand often manywho have believed in him or her. We just dont get to be competent human beings without a lot of different investments from others.

 We, your teachers, believe in you. We are here to help you be your best selves, and that is why we invest so much time in your education. Do not be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Weve got your back. Heres to a great week ahead.

 so I anticipate a busy school week as well. Coming together and celebrating with family and friends is an essential part of community building. In a year where we have been unable to all be together, these traditions become even more powerful symbols of hope and promise. It was so uplifting and affirming to see our own students on Friday laughing and playing with classmates across cohorts. We miss these community connections and are committed to bringing everyone together as soon and as often as we can do so safely.School is such an important part of who we are. From the time I stepped through the doors of Bethesda Baptist kindergarten on a steamy August morning in 1970, I have been a member of a school community. Those schools have changed over the intervening 50+ years; I have gone from being driven home by the Principle of Merrick-Moore elementary on my first day of first grade to teaching at Yale University to my current position as Director of the Upper School at DA. Granted the distance between Bethesda Baptist Church and Durham Academy is a scant 10 miles, but I like to think I have come a long way. However, I still vividly remember that first day with Ms. Sally Harper in first grade. I managed to behave myself, albeit begrudgingly, through the day, but, when it was time to go home, a clerical error caused her to direct me to the wrong bus. After a circuitous route that seemed to cover most of East Durham but never brought me close to my neighborhood, I returned to school on the same bus that was supposed to take me home. I marched to Ms. Harpers class and told her she was a wicked woman who lied to children. She tried to explain the error and help me find a way home, but I fled the room and attempted to hide in a janitors closet. Fortunately, patient adults who were practiced in dealing with a scared and indignant child helped me find my way home and continued to help me learn the skills I would need to cope with confusion and fear and plans that could occasionally run afoul of circumstances.I was reminded of this episode earlier this week by the passing of Beverly Cleary at the age of 104. I read many of Clearys books as a child and again as a parent, and it was during this second reading that I came to appreciate the power of empathy that permeates her portrait of childhood. One vivid portrayal of this confusion unfolds inRamona the Pest, thesecond of BeverlyClearys wonderful novels about the Quimby family. Ramona experiences the strangeness that is the first day of school, and despite her excitement and eagerness, Ramona continually misunderstands the teachers instructions. This begins with her first encounter with her new teacher, Miss Binney, when Ramona asks where she should sitSit here for the present, she said with a smile.A present! Thought Ramona, and knew at once she was going to like Miss Binney.Ramona spends the rest of the first day of school waiting for a present from her teacher, a present that never materializes.  The fictional Ramona handled her confusion and disappointment much better than little Rusty Wilson. But it is those moments in Clearys stories that recall my own experiences of what it was like to be a child. And those patient adults, like the fictional Miss Binney or the real Ms. Harper, who comfort confused and angry children, remain role models of perspective and empathy and kindness. So as an adultI may be unable to see the world with the same wonder and puzzlement thatI experienced as a child, butI hope I have learned to respect and appreciate that perspective. I can empathize with the confusion. I can remember thatI too was a child once. And I can appreciate the simple pleasure of a field day and the joy of running around with friends and living in the moment.Thank you, Beverly Cleary, for your reminders that while confusion is ever present, so too are patience and love and empathy. Thank you, too, to all the advisors and or Dean of Students, Lindy Frasher, who helped coordinate our own celebration of community on Friday. It has been a long and, at times, frustrating year, but Friday was a good day. We will miss Beverly Cleary, but her spirit will be with us every time we remember what it is like to be blithe and young and among friends.Even while we continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, and wait six feet apart, we will still celebrate our community andLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Congratulations on surviving week two of distance learning. I have heard lots of great reports from students and families, and given our short transition time, you all are doing an amazing job. Thank you all for your ingenuity, your compassion and your hard work.Looking ahead to the 4thquarter, I wanted to share the following with you all. You should know that the schoolwide Administrative team continues to meet daily and the US Academic Committee is meeting weekly to address issues with this transition. We will keep listening and refining. I greatly appreciate all of your honest feedback as we work to get this right.Having looked over the data from the survey that continues to come in and hearing accounts from you all in emails and meetings, we are going to make a slight adjustment to our schedule. We are shortening class time to 75 minutes to allow for less screen time and more lunch time during the day. Yes, we heard you.We are also adding tutorial to the end of each day and building a block for faculty and student meetings. We want to make a couple of adjustments, but we also want to keep the consistency we have generated in our first fortnight of distance learning.Students: please note that your B and D periods will start a little earlier on Tuesday. Class Rotation-Option 2Day 1Day 28:30Wellness PostsAdvisory Check-in9:00-10:15AE10:30-11:45BFLunchLunch12:30-1:45CG2:00-3:15DFaculty MeetingsStudent Meetings3:20-3:50TutorialTutorialAfternoonPhysical ActivityMindfulness4th Quarter GradesAs we move into the fourth quarter with eight days of practical experience with online education, we recognize that our new learning environments require new approaches, ones that take into account issues of equity and the emotional and medical realities of the COVID-19 pandemic.We want to continue to promote learning while also taking some of the pressure off of our students. To accomplish this we need to be realistic about their abilities and provide a means for students to do their best work in these trying circumstances. We want to provide latitude for our teachers and our students, allowing both to focus on skills acquisition and thoughtful feedback without being bound by traditional grading and assessments that are more difficult to calibrate in the virtual classroom. We will strive to err on the side of grace for all.After consulting with our faculty and academic leaders, and gleaning insights from peer independent schools and colleges and universities across the country, we have made the decision to move away from traditional grades for the fourth quarter.We will calculate a student's grade for the year based on grades in the first three quarters and finalized based on performance in the fourth. Already, colleges only see a single grade for each course on DA student transcripts, so this will allow us to produce consistent transcripts that are easily processed by college admission offices. Our goal is to have a transcript that accurately reflects a student's work for this academic year.Work completed during the fourth quarter will be evaluated with a simplified system: Satisfactory Plus, Satisfactory, Satisfactory Minus, or Not Satisfactory.Under this model, students still have an opportunity to affect their final grade based on fourth quarter performance. Exceptional effort or underperformance may slightly raise or lower a student's grade, but typically the bulk of a student's grade for the year is formed in the first three quarters, and thus such changes would be the exception. Parents and students will be contacted via email during the quarter if a student is failing to submit work or attend online classes.If a students work during the fourth quarter shows exceptional effort or underperformance, a teacher will consult with their departments Academic Leader and Upper School Division Director and a grade change will be taken under consideration. Teachers will still be assessing assignments and offering direct feedback to students. Course work still matters. At the same time, we must acknowledge the variety of situations in homes (technological, emotional, medical, economic), the difficulty of ensuring academic integrity from a distance, and the general level of stress in our community and beyond.Teachers will share a general course update in mid-April via Quick Post on Veracross that describes the work being done in each class so expectations for the remainder of the academic year are clear and understood by both students and parents. This will not be a comment on an individual students performance.Teachers will write individual comments by June 1 for all students. As one Academic Leader noted, it will be a nice way to leave a parting message, reflect on the year, and to celebrate overall accomplishments. At this point and under these circumstances, I'd be happy to end the year on a positive note.We are confident that these changes will allow learning to flourish by focusing on academic growth, encouraging teachers and students to be creative, and removing the potential for anxiety surrounding grades in these extraordinary circumstances. Our faculty will continue to teach at the highest levels and engage our students with both a passion for their subjects and compassion for our students.AP ExamsI sent this out on Friday, but I wanted to share here as well.Students in AP courses will not be required to take the AP exams.Courses for seniors will follow the previously published schedule and end on May 8 (even if students choose the April exam date). We expect all DA students to test on the May exam dates.The school will continue to handle payment to the College Board. You have already been billed for the exams you registered for. If you want to cancel and receive a refund, you should fill out this form by April 20. The AP exam schedule should be available on April 3.I know thats a lot to take in, but please know that we want to get this right an make it work. The survey Mr. Ulku-Steiner sent on Wednesday closes tonight, and on Monday morning, our Administrative Team will meet to discuss emergent themes and opportunities to adjust our online learning programs.Click here to respond if you havent done so already.And finallyI hope you are doing well. It can feel disconcerting to be so disconnected, but in another sense this crisis connects us all in a way we have not been before. This is all new and strange, but we are all in this working together. We are here for one another, and the work we are doing is even more collaborative than before. I hope you can get away from the screens this afternoon and tomorrow. But before you do, I wanted to share a special message from a friend of mine. It popped up on my phone earlier this week and it made me smile and take hope.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

The poet T.S. Eliot famously opened his epic poem The Waste Land claiming, April is the cruelest month. While I might not have chosen the same adjective as Eliot to describe this coming month, I do agree that April can be (pardon the pun) taxing. I always look to April as the most challenging part of the school year, the penultimate leg of a very long race. Events come at us with furious speedthird quarter ends and comments are due, the pace of the march towards AP exams increases, assemblies come every other day, elections, Special Olympics, Prom, the list can be overwhelming. Meanwhile the weather gets a little warmer, we begin to anticipate summer, and the student body invariably starts to get a little squirrelly. Spring is in the air, both literally and metaphorically. Pollen starts to compose a large percentage of the air we breathe and hormones get cranked up to eleven. There is a reason this month is named after Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of loveand a reason we begin the month by honoring fools (and Upper School Directors!).April is also National Volunteer Month and National Poetry Month and Autism Awareness Month. So much to celebrate. Over the course of April we will touch on all of these. We will have What Matters to Me presentations and community service on 4/10, a Poetry Assembly on 4/11, and Special Olympics is just over the horizon on 4/26. This week we continue our student government elections (4/3), learn more about our Cavalier Capstones (4/4), and revel in the song stylings of In The Pocket (4/5). As we tumble headlong into April I encourage everyone to take the time to appreciate the rebirth of the natural world. I highly recommend a visit to Duke Gardens if you want to witness Spring in its full glory. Appreciate the vivid yellow of the forsythia, the bright magenta of the redbud tree, the magnificent blue of a cloudless sky. Why not go outside and splash around in a mud puddle? Use natures rebirth as an inspiration for the coming month. Refocus your efforts, recommit to your goals for the year, run this leg of the race just a little faster, and, above all else, try something new. No week in April will be the same. New challenges and new opportunities will present themselves. In the beautifully wrought words of e e cummingsin Just- spring when the world is mud- luscious the little lame balloonman whistles far and wee and eddieandbill come running from marbles and piracies and it's spring when the world is puddle-wonderful the queer old balloonman whistles far and wee and bettyandisbel come dancing from hop-scotch and jump-rope and it's spring and  the  goat-footed balloonMan whistles far and weeApril is here, and the world is mud-lucious and puddle wonderful.

Welcome to windy March and the last week of classes before Spring Break. To be honest, I was feeling a little frayed around the edges toward the end of last week, but I spent my Saturday reading through the almost sixty nominations for this weeks Magnificent Community Assembly. If you want to gain a clear perspective on the special nature of the upper school, all you have to do is read through these wonderful nominations. There are so many amazing young people and adults at this school. I am so very proud of this years batch of nominees, but I am even prouder of the selfless folks who took the time to write the many beautiful words praising their peers. Wednesday will be an amazing day, so I hope you are ready to celebrate one another.Also this week, Tuesday finds us hosting our second Giving Day. We are going to kick off the day on Facebook Live, and we would like everyone to be in Kenan and seated by 8 a.m. (I know it is early, but lets fill Kenan!) Mr. Ulku-Steiner and Mr. Hark will introduce Giving Day from the stage and then on cue, reveal our hidden audience (you) to start the days celebrations. To incentivize student participation that morning, there will be some hidden prizes for those who attend!If that was not enough, you also have a little extra incentive to make your $1 gift on Giving Day.<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>Your $1 gift automatically enters you in a raffle for a basket of gift cards to your favorite food spots.<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>Your classes will also be competing  the class with the highest percentage of participation wins a LoYo On The Go party. The winning class must have at least 65% participation. (Last years seniors had 100% participation from every senior on campus that day.)Thank you for supporting Durham Academy!You will have lots of opportunities to be magnificent this weekgiving back to DA, giving to the greater Durham community, giving to one another. It promises to be a special week.I want to close this weeks YLT by sharing a note from Ethan Goldman. Many of you know that I was Roger Bannisters self-proclaimed biggest fan. His accomplishments on and off the track inspired me when I was a fledgling young runner. Both the first man to break four minutes in the mile, and knighted for his accomplishments in the field of neurology, I looked to Bannister as a model of a life well lived. This morning, the BBC announced that Bannister had died last night at the age of 88. His death was not unexpected, but it saddened me greatly when I read that we had lost such an icon of track and field. I hope you all take a moment to reflect on your own mortality; it seems unlikely that any of our group will ever break four minutes in the mile or be knighted, but the lesson I think Sir Roger would want us to take away from his life is that we all die, so why not spend our lives doing what brings us joy? I hope I havent bored you all by waxing poetic for too long. Here is a link to the BBC where you can read a short article about Bannisters life: http://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/43273249.Ethan is right. We may never break four minutes in a mile or be knighted for our work, but that should never stop us from embracing the things we love and always striving to be our best selves. In honor of Sir Roger Bannister letslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you have made the most of this beautiful weekend. Whether celebrating Easter this Sunday morning or Passover on Friday and Saturday evening or the arrival of Spring all

 this week, we should all feel grateful for a new season of promise and rebirth and hope.



In her poem Spring, Edna St. Vincent Millay asks, To what purpose, April. Do you return again? and observesyearly, down this hill/April/comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing

 flowers. I have always embraced April as the most promise-filled part of the school year, the penultimate leg of a very long race. Events come at us with furious speedthird quarter has ended and comments are due, the pace of the march towards AP exams

 increases, assemblies arrive with greater frequency, elections, International Day, Special Olympics, Prom, the list can be overwhelming. Meanwhile the weather gets a little warmer, we begin to anticipate summer, and the student body invariably starts to get

 a little squirrelly. Spring is in the air, both literally and metaphorically, as the birds and frogs fill the air with love songs and pollen starts to compose a large percentage of the air we breathe and hormones get cranked up to eleven. There is a reason

 this month is named after Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of loveand a reason we begin the month by honoring fools.

As we tumble headlong into April I encourage everyone to take the time to appreciate the rebirth of the natural world. Acknowledge the brilliant white of the dogwood blossom (our

 state flower), the bright magenta of the redbud tree, the translucent green of deciduous trees reclaiming the canopy, the magnificent blue of a cloudless sky. Why not go outside and splash around in a mud puddle? There are tadpoles out there waiting to be

 discovered. Use natures rebirth as an inspiration for the coming month. Refocus your efforts, recommit to your goals for the year, run this leg of the race just a little faster, and, above all else, try something new. No week in April will be the same.

 New challenges and new opportunities will present themselves. Sample a new dish on International day, make a new friend at Special Os, try out that new dance move at the prom, run for office, go big.

I will leave you with the words of another favorite poet, Thomas Carew

Now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost
Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost
Candies the grass, or casts an icy cream
Upon the silver lake or crystal stream;
But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth,
And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth
To the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree
The drowsy cuckoo and the humble-bee.
Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring
In triumph to the world the youthful spring.
 - The Spring (1630)


Spring belongs to the young. April is herelaugh

I hope this Sunday morning finds everyone well. Last nights thunder storms were a welcome respite from skies filled with pollen. Heres hoping that they arrived in time to replenish the puddles filled with tadpoles along Morgan Creek. I am at heart a sensitive person, and I start to complain when theres no rain. I am always thrilled to see the puddles fill with tiny wiggling black pre-frogs, but I start to worry as the dry spells drag on and the puddles slowly shrink creating little writhing black masses. Way back in the last century, I had a friend in New Haven who studied frogs and the choices they made when it came time to lay their eggs. He explained to me that ponds are good because they are always filled with water, but they are also filled with predators that like to snack on eggs and tadpoles and polywogs. Puddles are safer because they lack predators, but they are also prone to drying up in the event of a dry spell. Every spring, frogs must make a choice, balancing risks and rewards, hoping to make the right call to preserve the next generation. Throughout this year, I have often found myself feeling like a mother frog, balancing risks and rewards, always trying to make the right choice to anticipate the vicissitudes of nature in order to keep my tadpoles safe. In the face of a pandemic we have consulted the experts, followed CDC guidelines and instituted mitigation strategies that would allow us to carry out our mission and keep our students safe. As the year draws to a close, we continue to balance the risks and the rewards, seeking to give our students the best possible experience without placing those in our community at risk. These choices have not been easy because each of our 452 students and their families have a different sense of risk. As a parent it is easy to make decisions for my senior daughter, but as an administrator I must take off my parent hat and make decisions for 451 other sons and daughters. And I assure you these decisions are never taken lightly.This week we have made some decisions that will help keep our students safe while opening up the opportunity of bringing more students to campus. One immediate change will be our move away from morning temperature checks. The CDC and DHHS no longer recommend doing them, so we can and should spend our time and energy planning for the return to full capacity. Instead, we are asking that all our upper school students use the Safer Together web app to check in each morning. Our seniors have been doing this for a couple of weeks now, so we know this works well. Attached you will find simple instructions for completing the daily check-ins with Safer Together. The PDF also includes a link to a 1-minute video tutorial that demonstrates the process. We still need our families to be vigilant about symptoms and avoid sending students to school if they are symptomatic, but our Safer Together app should streamline this process and require less work from the parent and faculty volunteers who have been so essential all year. Thanks to all our volunteers, but especially Karen Triplett who organized our sign-up at the upper school and always stepped in when we were short on volunteers.Also this week we will be offering a vaccine clinic on Tuesday for all our community members 16 years and older. Thanks to everyone who has signed up for our vaccine clinic so far. If you have not done so, please fill out this interest form . The SignUpGenius email will be arriving later today. At last count we had almost 200 people registered which means a two-hour window for our clinic (1-3 pm). The folks at Health Park Pharmacy will update me tomorrow, and if we have more than 200 we can extend the clinic hours. If you have registered, please be on the lookout for the SignUp email that will also have all the details you need.So as we gaze hopefully at the light at the end of the tunnel, we will anticipate the promise, appreciate the process, and continue to apply the mitigation protocols. We are not out of the woods yet, but we will get there together and safely, and until then, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Whether celebrating Passover or Easter or the coming vernal equinox, I hope the long weekend has allowed for rest and reflection. Both Passover and Easter carry so much symbolic resonance. The arrival of Spring (dogwood blossoms and azalea blooms and green thoughts in a green shade), the symbols of rebirth (lambs and bunnies and eggs), the emphasis on hope in the face of seeming defeat, and, most importantly, the embracing of forgiveness and love and responsibility. These are valuable concepts no matter what your belief system. The need for friends and family and faith becomes so obvious when we face a crisis. If you celebrated this week, I hope you were able to connect with the people that afford meaning to your life. I hope you were able to (at least virtually) embrace your loved ones and draw strength by coming together. And since April is National Poetry month, I thought it appropriate to share a poem this morning. This happens to be a sonnet from Gerard Manly Hopkins. Hopkins was one of many artists that struggled with depression during his life but used his faith and his love of the natural world to find a light in the darkness. Although he experienced little success in publishing his works, his college friend, Robert Bridges, managed to publish his poems nearly twenty years after Hopkins death. Hopkins never experienced the success that his poems were to find, but he continued to write and create and add beauty to the world. And he had a friend that recognized that beauty and kept it alive and shared it with the rest of us. You need not explore the concept of sprung rhythm to gain a better understanding of Hopkins; you only need to take a couple of minutes and read the poem aloud. Listen for the alliteration and the rolling rhythm that suggest the movement of the bird riding on the breeze. And pay attention to the final tercet with its image of light and beauty found even among the dying embers. There is hope and beauty in the world, even when the days seem dark. The Windhover To Christ our LordI CAUGHT this morning mornings minion, king-  dom of daylights dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding  Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing, As a skates heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding  Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding Stirred for a bird,the achieve of; the mastery of the thing!  Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here  Buckle!

No wonder of it: sher pld makes plough down sillion Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,  Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermillion.I encourage you all to find the light in your life and share it with the ones you love.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Greetings fromChicagowhere monocles are everywhere and I am writingYLT between meetings about school culture and competency based education and instructional coaching. Look for these topics coming soon to a classroom or faculty meeting near you! I love my annual visit to the INDEX conference because I love learning about what makes a good school work and how a good school becomes a great school, but I always have a touch of FOMO when I am away from campus. Last week was crammed full of extra-curricular learning opportunities, and the coming fortnight is filled with still more opportunities you do not want to miss: our Spring Dance concert, Special Os, Prom and (hopefully) the opening of our new Humanities classrooms. This is an exciting time of the year! It is also without a doubt one of the busiest times of the year, but the coming weeks always showcase our community and our students at their best.In Chicago, many of the topics I encountered in my conversations with other school leaders involved a close examination of the changing nature of education. How has technology changed how we learn? How has it changed how we think and process information? What are 21st century skills and how do we inculcate them in our charges?Surprisingly, one of the best answers came from William Johnson Cory, school master at Eton College, an all-boys school outside London, founded in 1440 and not a member of INDEX.At school you are engaged not so much in acquiring knowledge as in making mental efforts under criticism. A certain amount of knowledge you can indeed with average faculties acquire so as to retain; nor need you regret the hours you spent on much that is forgotten, for the shadow of lost knowledge at least protects you from many illusions. But you go to a great school not so much for knowledge as for arts and habits; for the habit of attention, for the art of expression, for the art of assuming at a moment's notice a new intellectual position, for the art of entering quickly into another person's thoughts, for the habit of submitting to censure and refutation, for the art of indicating assent or dissent in graduated terms, for the habit of regarding minute points of accuracy, for the art of working out what is possible in a given time, for taste, for discrimination, for mental courage, and for mental soberness. Above all, you go to a great school for self-knowledge. William Johnson Cory published these thoughts in Eton Reform II in 1861, but they make as much sense today as any of our modern educational assertions. Your education will touch on a very small percentage of the available knowledge in the universe, but the habit of attention, the art of expression and the self-knowledge you gain will stay with you throughout your life, and these are the true skills that will allow you to become your best self.

Greetings from Chicago where DB is writing
YLT in between meetings about school culture and courage and maximizing resilience. Look for these topics coming soon to a classroom or faculty meeting near you! I love my annual visit to the INDEX conference because I love learning about what makes
a good school work, but I always have a touch of FOMO when I am away from campus. The coming fortnight is filled with opportunities you do not want to miss: two assemblies, Special Os, Lip Synch V, the spring Dance Concert and Prom. Phew! It is without
a doubt one of the busiest times of the year, but Special Os will always be the highlight of my year, and the coming weeks always showcase our community and our students at their best.
Many of you may not know that once upon a time, I was a teacher of English, and as such I have a heightened sensitivity to grammar; its misuse sounds on my ears like a Taylor Swift cover of Earth, Wind and Fire.
Its just jarring to my sensibilities. I am constantly trying to impress upon my students, my children, and strangers in coffee shops the need to speak and write in a manner that is both clear and precise, and I am not above the occasional pedantic public
correction of grammar. I have even been known to shout at the television when someone says  between you and I.Pronouns following prepositions take the objective case! At least once a week I will ask a student how he or she is doing, and I am often greeted with the phrase, I am doing good. Attentive classmates will gasp, because they know what is going to happen
next. I explain that doing good involves feeding the hungry, helping a classmate, or some similar charitable activity. The students who have fallen into my grammatical trap will quickly respond that they are, in fact, doing well, or were doing well until
this seemingly friendly exchange turned into a lesson in grammar. And thus, I continue to swim against the tide, bringing grammar to the masses, one awkward encounter at a time.
But on Friday when we host our friends and neighbors from the Durham Public schools there will be no need for correcting grammar, since we will all be doing good. And I do not mean this in a patronizing way,
because I think it is we, the members of the Durham Academy community, who get the most out of this day. By leaning into our new roles we tap into our personal store of knowledge and resources. You can only discover what you are truly made of when you venture
beyond your familiar routines. And that is what we accomplish on this day; in embracing an unfamiliar experience, minds open up, prejudices drop away, and smiles appear everywhere. I always feel so proud of our community on that day. We rise to the occasion,
we embrace our roles, and in doing so, we become our best selves.
All week long, but especially on Friday lets

The Muslim holy month of Ramadan commenced on Monday, April 12, and I decided to spend a little time this week learning more about the holy month and reflecting on my own understanding of the universe and my place in it. Growing up in East Durham, I was not exposed to a broad swath of this diverse world I inhabit. We were mostly black and white, mostly poor, and mostly from some sort of Protestant background. Not until I attended the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics did I meet friends who were Jewish or Catholic or Buddhist or Muslim. My education at NCSSM took place not just in the classroom, but also in very real terms in the many late night conversations in the dorm rooms, meeting people of so many different backgrounds who shared their upbringings and perspectives on the world.So what have I learned about Ramadan? During the entire holy month, Muslims fast every day from dawn to sunset. It is a time of spiritual disciplinea recommitment to ones faith through of deep contemplation of one's relationship with God. The month of fasting comprises extra prayer, increased charity and generosity, and intense study of the Quran. Fasting (sawm) during Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the profession of faith (shahada), prayer (salat), alms giving (zakat), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj). Ramadan teaches one to practice self-discipline, self-control, sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate, thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity. And like all holy days, it is filled with a contemplation of the mysteries of the divine.Ramadan You wanted to be so hungry, you would break into branches,and have to choose between the starving monthsnineteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-third evenings.The liturgy begins to echo itself and why does it matter?If the ground-water is too scarce one can stretch netsinto the air and harvest the fog.Hunger opens you to illiteracy,thirst makes clear the starving pattern,the thick night is so quiet, the spinning spider pauses,the angel stops whispering for a momentThe secret night could already be over,you will have to listen very carefullyYou are never going to know which nights mouth is sacredly recitingand which nights recitation is secretly mere windIn his poem Ramadan, Kazim Ali examines a night in the third week of Ramadan, Laylat al-Qadr (night of power), which is believed to be the night the angel Gabriel first recited the Quran to the Prophet Mohammed. According to tradition it is uncertain which night the recitation occurred, so many Muslims will celebrate on the 19th, 21st and 23rd  the odd-numbered dates of the last 10 days of the month.Alis poem examines the uncertainty of the evening during a moment of still contemplation. According to the poet, They just want to make sure that theyre actually doing the rituals on the night itself, but at the same time its also a metaphor to mefor the fundamental unknowability of the divine and therefore the unfixity of the divine. There could be no one day upon which anything is celebrated because its timeless.The fundamental unknowability of the divine links us all. We are all a part of the timeless fabric of the universe. Taking the time to understand one another, to reach beyond our selves to love and appreciate the beliefs of others, connects us in ways that permit us to be our best selves. The more we take time to understand others, the more we see our shared virtue. There is an inner light, a divine spark within all of us, and sometimes we require the practice of ceremonies and rituals to redirect us, to slow us down, to dim the light pollution of the material world so we can see this spark that resides in all of us.So as we contemplate the mysteries of the universe, we will reach out to one another with empathy and curiosity and a shared understanding of the good. We have much to learn, but we will get there together, and along the way, we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are managing to take care of yourselves and your family this week. I know we were all disappointed to hear from Mr. Ulku-Steiner on Tuesday that school would continue to operate remotely through the remainder of the year. Over a month ago I wrote that the reality of all the closures and cancellations might be giving way to a sense of sadness and frustration. I know that this latest news adds to that disappointment, but it is important to keep reminding ourselves that what we are doing right now is an amazing act of social solidarity. We are putting our regular lives on hold (and this means sacrificing some things we love and some things we have been looking forward to all year) so we can give nurses, doctors and hospital workers the time and space to help those who will fall ill. The sacrifices we make today will save lives tomorrow. Please know that what you are doing is noble and important.While many of you may have anticipated this news, it remains frustrating nonetheless and creates concerns about our traditional closing activities. We all miss the rituals of school and the daily opportunities to connect with peers and teachers and coaches. We miss the rites of passage like prom and Special Os and Commencement. April is always a busy month on campus as we set aside time to celebrate one another with music and dance assemblies and award ceremonies and community engagement. Special Os is always my favorite day because we get to see everyone in the greater Durham community come together to celebrate being our best selves. I will miss being all together of Friday, but we will do our best to make this day special nonetheless. Mrs. McDonald and the Special Olympics Committee have plans to help us celebrate and support our buddies from the Durham Public schools. Also on Friday, our student government is planning ways to support those members of our community who are in need. Even in our isolation we will act together for the greater good.Please also know that administrators and faculty and student leaders are working on other ways to stay connected during this major disruption to our lives. We are all in this together and we will make it through by supporting one another. And finally, thanks to the Rolling Stones for this little gift. I wish I looked half as cool as Charlie Watts when I play air drums at home. This is a great reminder that as we feel sad for our losses, we still have the space and opportunity to feel that loss. We still have our community. We still have our families. We still have opportunities in the future to gather and celebrate and come together. We just have to be patient and kind and gracious as we get through this together even as we have to stay apart.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Happy Passover and Easter. I hope the long weekend has allowed for rest and reflection. Both Passover and Easter carry so much symbolic resonance. The arrival of Spring (dogwood blossoms and azalea blooms and green thoughts in a green shade), the symbols of rebirth (lambs and bunnies and eggs), the emphasis on hope in the face of seeming defeat, and, most importantly, the embracing of forgiveness and love and responsibility. These are valuable concepts no matter what your belief system.I was raised a Southern Baptist and spent a great deal of my youth in church. I have read the Bible more than once, and while my understanding of the universe has changed as I have grown, I remain a big fan of the words written in red. I spent some time on Friday listening to the storms as they rolled through the area, reflecting on the state of the world and the promise of the future. As tornado warnings leapt from my phone my thoughts kept turning to keeping my family safe from the threats (both physical and emotional) of the universe, and I was grateful that the danger passed and left us unharmed.Because I am also a bit of a philosophical magpie, my contemplations that day tended to drift from the meteorological to the philosophical to the fantastic. I thought of another school director, Albus Dumbledore, and his ability to articulate ideas of hope and forgiveness and responsibility. In The Prisoner of Azkaban Dumbledore reminds us, Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light. As the storm clouds brought darkness to the day on Friday, I came to the following conclusions. I firmly believe that hope will win out over hate. I firmly believe that light will prevail over darkness. But I also believe we must be the ones to turn on the light and embrace those opportunities to demonstrate hope and forgiveness and love. Passover is about liberation and the responsibilities that come with freedom. Easter is about hope and the acts that follow from our faith.Next week is full of opportunities, but especially Special Os on Friday, to act on our beliefs. When we host our friends and neighbors from the Durham Public schools, we will be embracing our mission to be happy, moral, productive citizens of the world. We, the members of the Durham Academy community, will give action to our words. In sharing our time, in embracing an unfamiliar experience, in reaching out to others and walking not in their shoes but beside them, our minds will open up, prejudices will drop away, and smiles will appear everywhere. I always feel so proud of our community on this day. We rise to the occasion, we embrace our roles, and in doing so, we become our best selves. In the spirit of this weekend and the week ahead, I will leave you with my favorite quote from the Bible. It is spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper, a Seder celebrating Passover, and it is the mandate behind Maundy Thursday: A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another. Perhaps we only need one rule to make the world a better place for all of us.As always and especially on Fridaylaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Congratulations on making it to the last days ofApril.May we soon be free of the Pollening. AP exams commence next week, so thisYLTmarks the start of our seniors' last full week of classes. I say full with the clear understanding that many seniors will not be attending class on Friday in honor of St. Buellers Day. I hope the weather remains perfect and your Friday echoes the great weather we anticipate all week.So that your teachers are not wasting precious class time calling your names in vain, I wanted to remind seniors once again that all absences on Friday must be excused by a parent. Unexcused absences will be subject to disciplinary consequences, i.e., you will receive a detention for missing class unexcused. Also, only if your absence is excused may you participate in after school activities likes games and practices. The point being, please take care of your responsibilities if you are missing school on Friday. As Principal Rooney so elegantly stated, The last thing I need at this point in my career is 1,500 Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls. He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body!Also this week, we all will have lots of opportunities to pay it forward; just look at the announcements below if you want to find something that will make a difference. One obvious way is to participate inDA Giving Dayon Tuesday, April 27. This year's theme is One Day, One DA. This year in particular the DA community has so much to be grateful for, with teachers, coaches, advisors and volunteers all working together to keep us connected and keep us safe. DA Giving Day is the chance to say thank you for the people who have made a difference in your life this year. Check out theDA Giving Day pagefor more information about the $35,000 in challenges that you can help unlock with your giftand help spread the word on social media. Most importantly, get ready for a day of fun, gratitude and giving back! Your efforts this week will make a difference for future generations of DA students. April is always a busy month on campus as we set aside time to celebrate one another with music and dance performances and award ceremonies and community engagement. Special Os is always my favorite days because we get to see everyone in the greater Durham community come together to celebrate being our best selves. I will miss being all together again this year, but we will do our best to make this day special nonetheless. Mrs. McDonald and the Special Olympics Committee have plans to help us celebrate and support our buddies from the Durham Public schools through our Special Olympics Virtual Event. Even though we cannot host our buddies on campus, we will act together for the greater good.And finally, the return of APexamsto campus can cause a bit of confusion, so Mrs. Bessias will be sending out more information later today that will help clarify the process. Attendance expectations are one of those tricky areas, but the basic premise is simple. In order for you to be fully prepared for your exam, you are excused from classes for the half day preceding your exam. Therefore, if you have an afternoonAPexam, you are excused from your academic commitments on the morning immediately preceding the exam. If you have a morningAPexam, you are excused from your academic commitments on the afternoon immediately preceding the exam. And no, you may not leave early on Friday for a Monday morningAP(hence immediately preceding).Beginning at lunch, you may choose to sign out and leave campus if you have anAPexam the next morning. Senior privileges stillapply, but juniors and sophomores who leave campus may not return prior to the end of the school day. Simply put, only seniors with privileges are allowed to run off campus for lunch. Others doing so will result in a slew of consequences ranging from Saturday detention to loss of Senior privileges next year. Also, please remember to sign in and out when you arrive and leave campus. Check with me or Dean Frasher if this is unclear.So heres to spending a little time this week giving back to our school and our community. And just in case you are wondering what you get out of all thisgivingScience saysgivingwill make you happier. Here is a nice link to an infographic of thescience behindgivingLets make the most of our time together this week. Give. Be happier. Make the future a better place. We can all do our part to share our gifts, and still we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone was able to get out and walk a mile on Friday in honor of Special Olympics. I know our buddies in the Durham Public Schools were very happy to hear from us though the video messages and walks of support. I was able to walk my 34,000 steps to celebrate what would have been our 34th year of hosting the Durham County Spring Games. Along the way I was able to attend four Microsoft Teams meetings, make eight phone calls, and even say hello to a couple of DA students from a safe distance. Shout outs to ninth grader Georgie Rigby who hollered at me from her back yard and senior Bennett Dombcik who sped by me on his skate board. Although these encounters were brief, it was good to see students in real life (from an appropriately safe distance). I miss you all.Fridays Special Os celebrations are just one way we are trying to find opportunities to recreate all those extracurricular occasions that make school special. Now that we have our academic work in a comfortable routine, it is important to acknowledge what we are all recognizing: school is so much more than sitting in classes and learning. It is the community building activities that define who we are and make the DA experience so meaningful. Your administrators and teachers have been working tirelessly to not only maintain our high standards for intellectual engagement in the upper school but also generate community engagement even as we continue to shelter in place. The result of that work is the schedule you will find below. It will take us through AP exams and the end of the school year.Once we decided against final exams and once we realized we could not hold our Cavalier Capstones, we were able to add six class days to our regular schedule. This added class time also meant we could be a little creative with our Fridays in May and use those days to fill in some of the intangibles that fall outside traditional academic class time. We will continue to maintain our classes on a two-day rotation Monday through Thursday, but Fridays will be given over to community events and opportunities to make up work or prepare for AP exams. This coming Friday (5/1) is Senior Skip day. The senior class will be celebrating with some activities of their own making. They requested a little space to do their own programming, so we are happy to oblige. For our 9th, 10th and 11th graders, that day will be spent on elections for Honor Council and Student Government. Underclassmen should also expect to meet with teachers of classes in which they are behind or missing work. The following Friday (5/8) will be Senior Day. This is traditionally the last day of classes for seniors, so we plan to honor them with a host of activities and surprises. The entire upper school is working on ways to celebrate our graduating students. Our seniors can expect lots of love to come their way on this day.I am calling Friday the 15th and 22nd Aloha, Mr. Hand days in reference to one of my favorite movies, Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Mr. Hand is an American History teacher who visits one of his students, Jeff Spicoli, at home to reteach much of the class work that Spicoli missed because of frequent absences. Both Fridays will be used to make up work missed during the week because of AP exams (or any missing work in general). As we have traditionally done, students who are taking an afternoon exam (they are all afternoon exams this year) are excused from their morning classes to prepare for the AP. This always creates a disruption in our class schedule, so we will use the Fridays during the two weeks of AP exams to ensure that all of our students are able to keep up with the academic expectations. Some teachers may also be using Friday, 8 May and 15 May for AP review sessions. Friday, 22 May will be used primarily for those students who have work still outstanding for the quarter. Teachers will be meeting with individual students as needed to conclude the academic yearjust like Mr. Hand.Friday, 29 May will be our Commencement for the Upper School. Our Senior Celebratory Committee continues to meet to explore our options for the ceremony. We held a virtual Town Hall for our seniors last week, and we are looking to schedule a similar Town Hall for our senior parents this week. As we plan, we continue to pay attention to the Governors Executive orders for the state, consult plans for our peer institutions and explore all our options for our Commencement. Stay tuned for more news on that front.That is all for now. Please take care of yourselves and your loved ones. Even though we remain apart physically, we are all in this together. I encourage everyone to reach out to friends and loved ones to both give and receive support. A little love goes a long way.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.Tomorrow, I will have the profound privilege of presenting the Special Olympics athlete oath that will conclude our opening ceremony and kick off the games. I consider this a great honor because I love what Special Olympics represents and I love the fact that our school makes the decision every year to step away from the classroom to engage in community building and personal growth. This is what it means to attend a school that is mission drivena school that demonstrates its commitment to its principles and its community through its actions. I am proud to represent Durham Academy on the stage tomorrow. I am also humbled, because this duty has been performed by Dennis Cullen for more than a score of years, and as Mr. Cullen moves into retirement, this particular torch has been passed to me. At tomorrows ceremony, I will not only represent our school, I will also represent Mr. Cullen and his history at DA. I cannot begin to enumerate the myriad contributions that Dennis Cullen has made to the history of our school, but tomorrow, in this one act, I hope to honor him and his legacy, and I promise to be brave in the attempt.When I read the oath tomorrow, I also hope you all will take a moment to let those words sink in. Take a moment to process just what they mean and how they apply to all of us. As we near the end of the school year, we will have many opportunities to perform at our best. As AP and final exams loom on the horizon and our first awards assembly sits less than a fortnight away, we will all be faced with our own challengesand we will all want to win. And many of us will find the success we seek, but we might also find ourselves coming up short on occasion. The vagaries of fate and the vicissitudes of fortune can mean even our best efforts fall short of the top prize. The Special Olympics athlete oath acknowledges this incongruity. We all want to win, but we cannot all win. The oath emphasizes the importance of effort, and the true emphasis falls on achieving one's personal best. We must all learn that being ones best self is not a competition with others. It is an internal struggle that requires us to be brave in the attemptto acknowledge who we are, to give our best effort, and to take pride in working towards a goal. Tomorrow you will see athletes wearing blue ribbons and red ones and green ones and pink ones. And if you look closely, you can see who was first and who was third and who was fifth, but I encourage you to take a step back, to gain some perspective. Those ordinal numbers are a very small part of the big picture. I guarantee you that everyone wearing a ribbon, no matter what color, will also be wearing a smile, and so will their buddy, and so will everyone they meet. The winners tomorrow will be all of us who participated and gave our best and accepted that who we are is not determined by how we finish this race, but more importantly by how we run it. As always and especially tomorrowlaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are all well. These are strange times, and I am sure we are all struggling with the sudden and dramatic ways in which our lives have changed. We now have three weeks of distance learning under our belts, but I cannot say I have become accustomed to these new routines. The virtual meetings on Microsoft Teams have been a great way to see and hear my colleagues and students, but I do miss being in a real classroom, walking around campus, taking in a baseball game after school. Being away from campus has so clearly demonstrated that what we call school is so much more than just class time. I miss greeting students in the hallway (Good morning, Ava!). I miss the food trucks and having lunch with co-workers. I miss playing Scrabble in the faculty work room. I miss talking to students and feeling the hum of activity in the Learning Commons. We will get back to campus someday, but for now I hope you can find ways to make your days meaningful. I always send a to do list out at Thanksgiving, but I am sharing a modified version today to help bring a little more joy and hope into your world. Not all of these might work for you and your family, but me and mine, we have found that they help us navigate the emotional maze imposed upon us by the confinement. 1. Three Good ThingsAt the end of each day write down three good things about that day. They can be big ("I know what I want to do with my life!) or small (I saw a fox!!!); just write them down. Keep a list of these good things for the month of April.2. Awareness WalkTake a thirty minute walk and pause each time you notice something positive. Take a moment to appreciate the trees filling the canopy with green, the cry of a hawk, turtles lined up on a log, water cascading over a rock. Some of these items might even make it on your Three Good Things list.3. Meaningful PhotosYou always have your phone with you. Instead of taking another selfie, take a picture (or 2 or 7) of things that have meaning to youa family member, a pet, a childhood book or toy. Start a file in your phone. Next Sunday take 30 minutes to reflect on those images and the happiness they bring to your life.4. Random Acts of KindnessCall your grandparents. Write a letter to a friend. Smile at a passerby. Volunteer to help cook dinner or wash the dishes. Do at least one kind act intentionally each day. Others will welcome the gesture, and you will feel good about yourself.5. Check in NotesWrite a to someone who cares about you to see how they are doing. If you think about someone during the day, shoot them an email. It does not have to be muchjust a quick note saying that you are thinking about them. You will be glad you did and it will mean so much to others to know someone is thinking about them.6. SleepGet 8-10 hours each night. Your body and your mind will thank you. But please try to be consistent about when you go to bed and when you rise. Your body appreciates a regular sleep cycle, and it makes waking up in the morning so much easier.7. ExerciseFeel those endorphins coursing through your body and elevating your mood. Walk, run, dance, stretchjust move your body. Coach Babwahs Swole La Tengo arrives in your email every week and is a great place to find a physical challenge to motivate you during the week.8. Practice MindfulnessDownload an appthat has a guided meditation. Just 20 minutes can do all sorts ofgood for your brain parts.9. Listen to an albumIm not talking about having music playing in the background. Im talking drop the needle, find a sunny spot to sit and just listen to an album. If you are in the mood for something new, head over to Merge Records and order the new Waxahatchee album, Saint Cloud. My vinyl copy arrived in the mail last week, and it has been spinning on my turntable since. As Jeremy Larson at Pitchfork notes, The unsparing indie style of Chan Marshall or Liz Phair remains, but Saint Cloud is something far bigger. It isnt just talking to Lucinda Williams 1998 album Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, it pulls up right beside it, a vivid modern classic of folk and Americana. Its a record that suggests maybe if you slow down, life slows down with you, and everything is in bloom. I also hear that Childish Gambino dropped a new album.10. Play gamesNothing brings a family together like game night. Break out the UNO or Guess Who? or my favorite, Settlers of Catan. If there are no siblings around, beg a parent to play with you. Sunday night means Dungeons and Dragons in the Wilson household. Tonight, I hope Timm the Cleric will finally be recognized for his battle skills instead of being mocked by Toad Boy and Serpentinaalthough I do remain grateful for their rescuing Timm after he was knocked unconscious by those club wielding baboons. Adventure awaits!11. Learn to bakeI cannot make my regular visits to Guglhupf, so my wife made her Black Magic cake earlier this week, and I made a pan of biscuits this morning. Baking is both meditative and scrummy. Start with a simple pan of homemade brownies or some Toll House cookies. You will be the new favorite member of your family. You will also probably need to order some buttermilk, so keep in mind that Maple View Farm delivers every Thursday.12. Reread a book you loveTake up that old favorite and pore over all the familiar words and phrases. Relive that first letter from Hogwarts or that moment Katniss took her sisters place or the first arrival at Camp Half-Blood. It is a different thing to read for love rather than plot. Go slow and appreciate revisiting old friends and familiar places. I am currently spending the late afternoons with Quentin Compson and the myriad ghosts of Yoknapatawpha County.13. Find a way to helpThere are lots of folks who are struggling out there. Doctors and nurses on the frontlines. Service folks who have lost jobs. Family members who are stressed and over worked. Discover Durham has some suggestions, but helping at home can also make a huge difference. Every little bit helps. These are some recommendations that I and my family have found helpful. Do what you can to help others, but, just as importantly, do not hesitate to ask for help. We are all vital parts of this community, and we are here to support one another. Talk to you teachers and advisors. Reach out to Ms. Danser or Mrs. Frasher. You are not alone. We love you all and care about you all and we will make it through this.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you all have been able to process grades and comments with your families this weekend. I encourage you to speak with your teachers to follow up on their suggestions and gentle criticisms. Comments represent the start of a conversation, not an end. Constructive feedback is a necessary component of personal growth and self-improvement. When I was a kid my mother would put Merthiolate on my cuts and scrapes. It hurt like the dickens, but it was better than an infectionat least thats what my mom said. My advice: try to move past the sting and focus on improvement and growthand count yourself lucky that they banned that stuff before most of you were born.To get you in the proper frame of mind, I offer you today a couple of motivational posters from the 1920s. Charles Mather, chief of his familys Chicago printing house, sold what he called Constructive Organization Posters, inspirational and instructive lithographs designed to enhance efficiency in the workplace through art. They produced hundreds of different colorful motivational posters to be displayed in factories and offices. In fact, some of you may have seen the one I have hanging behind my desk at school. Of course, one has to question their success given that the series ended abruptly with the stock market crash in October of 1929. Nevertheless, I find these posters slightly humorous in their blunt approach to the pitfalls of workplace dynamics and the delicate nature of human foibles.I hope these help take away some of the sting and allow you to focus on the journey ahead. Please do have those conversations with your teachers. Appreciate the time your teachers took to share their insights and lets all work together to be our best selves. That said, I also welcome your feedbackas long as you say it with snap.The week ahead has plenty of opportunities to shine: Independent study opportunities, some amazing What Matters to Me workshops, community engagement and Poetry! Seize these opportunities to learn and grow.And as alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

A good Sunday to you all. I hope everyone is appreciating the brilliant sunshine this morning. While not as warm as I would like, it sure beats Saturdays cold and wet. I spent
much of the day sitting by the fire answering emails, working on calendars for next year and reading a novel. At least the rain cleared the air of pollen (temporarily). As I sit on my back porch and write this mornings
YLT, I can almost see the trees starting to green in real time, small leaves emerging from the lower branches before my eyes, and soon they will, as the
poet says, be Annihilating all thats made / To a green thought in a green shade.
Like the arrival of spring, the weeks ahead are also full of wonderful possibilities. We kick the week off in rockin fashion with a sneak preview of Saturdays
In The Pocket concert during Mondays Morning Meeting. These shows are always amazing (we have so much talent in our community), so go ahead and add this to your Saturday night plans.
On Wednesday we will also get to know our community a little better. We will start with the What Matters to Me classes during the morning: a great opportunity to share our interests and learn what makes brings our classmates joy and purpose. At lunch we will sample food from all over the world prepared by our classmates and their families. Then our sophomores and juniors will go out into Durham to partake in the work of community building while our 9th graders will remain on campus to learn about the best day of the yearSpecial Olympics. (Speaking of Special Os, juniors and seniors should pay attention to the announcements regarding sign-up for jobs next Friday. Froshes and sophs
have already been assigned the best jobs; you will be a buddy for an athlete.)
On Thursday we will have a special Morning Meeting to recognize Holocaust Remembrance Day and on Friday we will have our annual Distinguished Alum Assembly. Mark your calendars accordingly.
We have a full week ahead, filled with opportunities to share, to learn, to grow. April at DA is all about celebrating our community at its best. To that end, lets
laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Happy Mothers Day. I apologize for the tardiness of todays YLT, but I spent this morning with my family indulging in a little celebration. You see it is not only Mothers Day, but today is also the day my son, Claude, graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with Honors. We had anticipated heading over to Kenan Stadium this morning with all our family in tow (grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles), but instead we spent a quiet morning at home with just the immediate family. After a nice brunch we watched the some of the commencement speeches on line. Frank Bruni did a fine job addressing the UNC-Chapel Hill Class of 2020. While the ceremony was very different than we had imagined way back in February, the moment was still special. Even though the group was smaller, my son was still surrounded by the people who love him most and want to see him succeed in life. Parts of that circle had to join remotely, but the love and support were palpable nonetheless. The physical parameters may have changed, but the significance of the event, the celebration of four years of hard work, the recognition that he is ready for the next stage of his life and the pride we all take in his accomplishment remain the true defining features of this day. Those cannot be and were not diminished by social distancing and virtual ceremonies.I know that many of our DA seniors are also feeling the loss of these traditional rites. And while the venues and ceremonies will be altered by the pandemic, what does not change is our communitys support and celebration of our seniors. On Friday morning our senior advisors (with some help from Mr. Murray) kicked off Senior Day by driving to the homes of every senior to deliver warm wishes, lots of love, and an assortment of other items: yearbooks and caps & gowns and even diploma covers. We are still holding on to the diplomas for two reasons. Even though seniors had their last class at Durham Academy, there are still AP exams over the next fortnight, so some work still remains in high school. We also plan to celebrate our commencement to mark the transition from student to graduate before conferring diplomas. But this last week has been an opportunity for the upper school to celebrate our seniors. Mr. Pogach kicked off the week with a series of Senior Dinners celebrating our senior spring athletes. On Thursday Ms. McDonald shared the Senior Dance, choreographed entirely by students, and the Faculty Dance, dedicated to the Class of 2020. And after Friday mornings deliveries, Senior Awards were conferred by advisors and academic leaders via carefully coordinated Teams meetings throughout the afternoon. It was a great day to reconnect while celebrating and honoring our seniors.Speaking of work still left to doAP exams kick off on Monday. We have a couple of messages in the announcements concerning APs, so if you have not done so, please take a moment to view them. As we have done in years past, students who are taking an AP exam in the afternoon may be excused from their morning classes. And remember, the next two Fridays are set aside for making up missed work, so please reach out to your teachers if you will be missing class so everyone can plan accordingly. AP Exams may be taking a new form this year, but you are all well prepared for this challenge. I wish you all the best of luck, knowing that you are ready to conquer yet one more obstacle in this complicated school year.Looking forward to finishing the year safe and healthy and together.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Happy Mothers Day. I hope that you take a moment to thank your mom today for everything she has done for you in your life. Moms are the besteven when they can seem insistent. (For example, my mother still asks when I am going to finish my dissertation.) They always want you to be your best self; that is why they keep us on our toes and do not let us get away with our balderdash and skullduggery. This can be a thankless job, so today of all days take a moment to thank your mom for pushing you to be your best. I offer this poem as a reminder of all the wonderful little things that mothers do to make us feel just a little bit better about our place in the universe.Lunchbox Love NoteInside my lunchto my surprisea perfect heart-shapedlove note lies.The outside says,Will you be mine?and, Will you bemy valentine?I take it outand wonder whowould want to tell meI love you.Perhaps a girlwhos much too shyto hand it to meeye to eye.Or maybe itwas sweetly pennedin private bya secret friendWho found my lunchboxsitting byand slid the note inon the sly.Oh, Id be thrilledif it were Jo,the cute one inthe second row.Or could it befrom Jennifer?Has she found outIm sweet on her?My minds abuzz,my shoulders tense.I need no moreof this suspense.My stomach lurchingin my throat,I open upmy little note.Then wham! as ifit were a bomb,inside it reads,I love youMom.BY KENN NESBITTNow go tell your mom you love her.

I hope you are all ready for the final weeks of the 20-21 school yeara year that has been like no other. I was speaking to a friend this weekend, and they described their current state as being so overworked and tired that facing the final weeks of school is like squeezing the last little remains of toothpaste out of a completely flat tube. We have endured so many changes and challenges, but we have made it this far by hard work and patience and flexibility. We have continued to put so much effort into this year, and we will finish with the same determination and spirit that has guided us to this place.Seniors have one more day of AP exams before they head off into the wilderness on Tuesday for a different kind of challenge. I wish you all good weather, well blazed trails and level campgrounds. My best advice for senior challenge: pack light, stay hydrated, be patient with your trail mates and always have a pair of dry socks at the ready. The rest of our upper school students have a final week of classes before exams. I encourage you all to make the most of your time on campus. Meet with your teachers and take advantage of these final days of class to do your best work. Classes will end officially on our final Flex Friday (5/21). Monday (5/24) will be a virtual reading day. Classes will meet virtually in the morning and students will have the afternoon to study (see schedule below). Final exams begin officially on Tuesday (5/25).Heres to getting the most out of your tube of toothpaste in the coming weeks. We have work yet to do, but we will finish strong, and all the while continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to the last full week of classes. I hope you used the beautiful weather this weekend to recharge your educational and emotional batteries for the last push. Please tap into that last bit of reserves to finish up those final projects and AP exams. Your teachers are here to help, so if you are having difficulties with any outstanding work, please reach out to them or your advisor. This has been a strange fourth quarter, but, even at a distance, we still care about you and your education. AP exams kicked off last Monday and continue this week, and congratulations to those of you who mastered this new and slightly awkward format. To address this change in how the exams are administered, you should have received an email from Ms. Bessias last week asking you to take this very quicksurvey about your AP exam experience. DA receives no information from the College Board, so we need your help to know how things went last week and to look for any patterns where there might be problems. Please fill it out even if everything went smoothly or if you contacted Ms. Bessias separately about an issue.We cannot control the College Board, but we want to support our students taking the exams to the best of our ability, and your feedback will help us do so.And finally, what better way to celebrate the closing of the school year than with a yearbook. We will have two locations set up on Friday morning (5/22) for distribution. Spring sports teams will return uniforms and collect yearbooks in front of Kirby Gym while other upper school students will receive their yearbooks in front of Kenan Auditorium. Please remember to wear a mask and, as much as you might want to hug Mr. Murray (lord knows I do for all the hard work he has put in to getting these yearbooks to you all), you must stay 6 feet apart. Please follow the schedules set out below.Coach Pogach will be collecting uniforms for our spring sports teams in front of Kirby Gym. Please have all parts of your uniform washed and in a labeled plastic bag. You will exchange your uniform bag for your athletics letter/pin (varsity teams) and be able to pick up your yearbook (for 9th-11th graders) at the same time. For those teams that do not have their uniform or do not return their uniform, please still arrive at your scheduled time to receive your letter/pin. (If you are part of a family with siblings on multiple teams, please arrive at the earlier time slot.)If you have a conflict and cannot arrive during your designated time, please email Coach Pogach. There will be a back-up date announced after May 22.VARSITY BOYS AND GIRLS TRACK 9:00 - 9:30 AMV BASEBALL / V SOFTBALL / V GOLF 9:30 - 10:00 AMV SOCCER / V LACROSSE 10:00 - 10:30 AMV / JV GIRLS LAX / V TENNIS 10:30 - 11:00 AMJV BASEBALL / JV TENNIS 11:00 - 11:30 AMMS BOYS AND GIRLS TRACK 11:30 AM - 12 NOONAll other Upper School studentswho are not returning uniforms should pick up their yearbooks along theKENAN breezeway.Mr. Murray will have a sign in and pick up table there.  9th grade: 9  10 am10th grade: 10  11 am11th grade: 11  noonCongratulations on making it to the final stretch.

What a busy week ahead. While our froshes, sophs and juniors face the final challenge of end of year exams, we will also be celebrating our seniors with a dinner on Wednesday, a pre-rehearsal picnic on Thursday and Commencement on Friday. These folks are almost college bound. Thursday marks their last day on campus, and on Friday we will bid a final farewell to the Class of 2019. This is our chance to celebrate their past at DA while looking forward to the promise of their futurea future that starts next fall with college.For our underclassmen, we only have one day of classes left before exams begin, so our goals are less lofty and more practical: study, sleep, repeat. (I hope you are ready.) On Monday we will hold our 9-11 awards assembly, and we will kick things off with our moving up ceremony. Once the chaos settles, you all will get a little taste of life next year in your new locations in Kenan. You are not quite finished yet, but you are now going to get to see what all the fuss is about. Juniors will occupy the coveted center seats in Kenan. Sophomores will gain a glimpse of what it is like to see the world from the other side of the room. Froshes get to move down from the balcony and join the ranks of the "been there and done that" crowd. Also worth noting, we will wrap up on Monday afternoon at 3:00 with an informal reception on the quad. This is an opportunity to say good bye to our departing faculty: Dennis Cullen has taught math at DA for 43 years; Jim Speir is concluding 40 years of service at DA, with roles including history teacher, assistant head of school and interim head of school; Edith Keene has taught Latin at the school for 39 years; Margarita Throop has taught Spanish at DA for 28 years; Alison Mattox is finishing her fifth year of teaching English; and Isabel Rios-Torres has taught Spanish at DA for four years. All tolled thats 159 years of collective service to the Durham Academy Community. Please stop by for a popsicle and a hug and share your thanks for the amazing service of these outstanding teachers.Lets finish the week on a strong note. Study hard. Find a reason to laugh with someone. Say Thank You like you mean it. Keep making the world a better place for others.As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

We are looking forward to welcoming everyone to campus tomorrow. This is going to be excitingand a little differentbut we have been looking forward to this for a very long time. Please be patient with everyone tomorrow. The hallways will be a little busier, and the classrooms will be a little fuller, but we moved the desks in last week so we have already grown accustomed to the new layouts. Just know that everything will take a little longer and will seem a little unfamiliar at first. Be patient, be flexible, be gracious.Things that will not change:You still need to Sign In every morning using the SaferTogether app.Our safety protocols remain the same. We will wear our masks indoors, only eat and drink outdoors, and wash our hands throughout the day. We will sit a little closer in the classroom, but we will keep our distance outside the classroom setting.You will need to pay attention to walking the correct direction in the hallways. More foot traffic will require everyone to move in a common direction. Please note: you are not the exception to this rule.The schedule will stay the same. Drop off and pick up will be slightly more crowded, so you might want to give yourself a little extra time in the morning.Things that will change:I have included the Advisory/Class Meeting schedule for each day below. One day each week is set aside for a full class meeting in the quad. You will be in advisory for the other days.We have already started this process, but lunch is no longer by advisory. We will instead eat by grade in the assigned locations.  Seniors: Quad Junior: Quad Sophomores: K Commons Froshes: Tennis Court Pavilion AP exams kickoff this week, so we are asking that students avoid making noise along the wall of Kenan Auditorium and near the yoga room in Kirby Gym. Please be respectful of your peers as they focus on these culminating assessments. If you are taking an AP exam, you are excused from classes for the half day immediately prior to the exam. For example, if you are taking an exam on a Tuesday afternoon, you are excused from your Tuesday morning classes. If you are taking a Thursday morning exam, you are excused from Wednesday afternoon classes. You may leave campus at 11:30 am, if you are taking an exam the next morning. As alwaysplease remember to sign out when leaving campus early for any reason.If you have two exams on the same day, you may be excused for the entire day prior to the exams.Also, if you are taking a Monday morning exam, you are NOT excused from Friday afternoon classes. That would be silly. For seniors, the last day you are expected to attend each class is Friday, 7 Mayorthe day of the AP Exam if that class has an AP exam before 7 May. Senior exams for non-AP Courses will take place next week (May 10  14). To accommodate the AP exam schedule, these exam times should be arranged with your teacher. Teachers may opt to waive the exam/final assessment if a senior has an A- or better average for the second semester. However, teachers CAN give you an exam even if your grade is an A+. All teachers must give a final assessment if your second semester grade is below an A-.Good luck to all our AP examiners.After more than a year, we will finally be all together, but we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

What a busy week ahead. While our Seniors returned on Saturday from our first ever Spring Senior Challenge, our froshes, sophs and juniors have been preparing to face the final challenge of end of year exams. As our younger students wrap up their academic commitments this week, we continue celebrating our seniors with Prom on Tuesday, a pre-rehearsal ice cream social on Thursday and Commencement on Friday. Our seniors are almost college bound, but we still have a week together to commemorate all the hard work and effort that helped us make it through this year. Friday marks last day on campus for the Class of 2021, and we will bid a final farewell to at 6:00 pm on the K Family Outdoor Commons. While seating is still limited to family pods of four, we will be livestreaming the event on Vimeo for friends and relations. This is our chance to celebrate their time at DA while looking forward to the promise of their futurea future that starts next fall with college. For our underclassmen, we only have a virtual Reading Day on Monday before exams begin in person and on campus on Tuesday, so our goals are less lofty and more practical: study, sleep, repeat. (I hope you are ready.) You are not quite finished yet, but you are so close to the finish line. Stay strong. Teachers are available on Monday to answer questions about their final assessments and assist with any last-minute exam prep. Snacks will be available at the Kirby concession stand between 10 and noon on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to help students (and faculty) refuel before afternoon exams. After Memorial Day, we will wrap up this very long year with Capstones. You all should have heard from your faculty leaders and be ready to roll next week. Capstones will be a great way to bring closure to this year.While we have work yet to do, we can see the finish line and we will end the year with our best work, and all the whileLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

This will be the final YLT of what has been a long, strange ride of a year. Classes will wrap up on Tuesday and Wednesday, and on Friday at 2:00 we will hold our virtual Commencement. We invite everyone in our community to join us for this digital version of our traditional ceremony with speakers and individual recognition of all our seniors in their caps and gowns. The link will go live at 2:00 p.m. on Friday and later that afternoon and into Saturday morning there will be smaller, in-person presentations of diplomas on campus to individual students and family members. I will send more details to our senior families later this week. It will be good to see our seniors one last time as they complete their journey and become Durham Academy graduates.I know this last part of the year has been a sad one for so many in our community. The need to be apart has left us without those important touchstones that define our community. But the sacrifices we made throughout the spring were an amazing act of social solidarity. All of us put our regular lives on hold so researchers, nurses, doctors and hospitals could have the time and space to help those who fell ill. By remaining at home and foregoing your traditional rites and ceremonies, you slowed the spread of the virus and that has saved lives. While it was not the way we envisioned our spring, what you did was noble and important. And you met the challenge in so many ways. From gratitude videos, to the home deliveries by the senior advisors, to sewing masks, to raising money, to reinventing Special Os, you kept our community together, supporting one another in ways that make me so proud to be a part of the Durham Academy family. I want to thank you all, teachers and staff and students and parents, for working together to find ways to stay connected, to keep learning, to celebrate even as we sacrificed.As we move into summer, if your plans have changed and you have been sitting on a big idea for an independent project, we now have an opportunity to support your dreams. Earlier this month, the Linger family generously created The Jack Linger Independent Study Fund to honor Jack, Class of 2020, and provide financial resources to rising junior and senior DA students looking to create their own independent projects that could be characterized as unique, enriching and outside of the box. Starting this year, an annual summer grant will afford one or more students the opportunity to expand their personal horizons and step outside of their own comfort zones through the pursuit of independent study projects. Because we know that many of you might have lost your summer opportunities, we wanted to make this available as soon as possible. Last June, Jack Linger embarked on a solo, 3,500-mile, cross-country bicycle trip from Anacortes, Washington, to Brunswick, Maine, traveling through 11 states and Canada. To celebrate the spirit of Jack and all who want to learn and explore and see the world, we are so pleased to make this opportunity available. If you are interested, please submit an Independent Study Proposal by 15 June to Tina Bessias. We will announce recipients the following week.That is all for now. Continue to dream big, to take care of yourself and your families, to put good into the universe, to be your best selves.Until next fallLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

When I first started YLT way back in 2014, I merely imagined it as a way to consolidate schedules and keep everyone apprised of the week ahead. Its principle purpose was to anticipate questions that I was often asked during the week about daily events and changing schedules. Somewhere along the way I started pontificating. I apologize for the inconvenience this might cause, and you should always feel free to skip the bloviation and go straight to the information. I promise I will not be offended.The last few weeks have been rough for many of us. Even in the best of circumstances, high school can be an exhausting ordeal and we are very near the end of this particular marathon. You have been pushing a very big rock up a very big hill for a very long time. But this is not the last rock nor the last hill you will encounter. Throughout your life you will need support along the way. Relationships need to be tended like gardens. Communities need to be held together with compassion and empathy and kindness. As we all stumble into May, please embrace the best parts of yourself. This may be difficult as you tax your own depleted resources, but it will make a difference. I encourage you to try one, or better yet all, of the following verbs this week. It will make a difference for you and someone else.Monday- Empathize Tuesday- ForgiveWednesday- Let goThursday- LaughFriday-ShareI realize these are just words. We cannot turn off our emotions, dispel our frustrations or discover happiness and kindness and peace because someone tells us to do these things. We have to work through our emotions as we work toward understanding and acceptance. I spent much of this weekend in a funk. I was tired from the week and my thoughts could not be distracted from school issues. I spent a lot of my time on Saturday in a brown study. My daughter, recognizing my mood, reminded me of a book she wrote for me when she was twelve,The Little Book of Happiness. In it she shared phrases and images from her own pre-teen journal that she collected when she was sad. It made a difference for me then and again this weekend.I have chosen to share this treasure with you because it is an example of how we can reach out to others and, by combining empathy and creativity, bring a little happiness to someone elses life. I hope it brings some to yours. Feel free to write your own version and share it with someone you love. After all, we are all in this together.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to the beginning of AP Exam week. This gift is brought to you by the College Board (the good folks that also bring you the PSAT and everyone's favorite, the SAT). Their goal is to challenge your intellectual skills and strain your endurance abilities. I will give you all the same advice I gave my daughter this morning who is nervous about taking her first AP exam this week: Do not let the College Board intimidate you. You have spent the school year mastering the information and the skills necessary to do well. You are prepared. You are confident. You will prevail. The AP schedule has already been posted around campus. If you are not taking an AP, please respect the fact that others are and keep the loudness away from testing areas (primarily Kenan and the Administrative wing of the LC). Since Kenan will be occupied, we will not have Morning Meetings this week nor next. Class meetings will be held in Kirby Gym or the LC. Check with your advisors for times and locations. When in doubt, at 10:05 go to advisory.Given the chaos of exam weeks, I hope to clear up a little confusion about AP exams and when one might miss classes prior to an exam. If you are taking an AP exam, you are excused from classes for the half day immediately prior to the exam. For example, if you are taking an exam on a Tuesday afternoon, you are excused from your Tuesday morning classes. If you are taking a Thursday morning exam, you are excused from Wednesday afternoon classes. Lunch is included here, so you may leave campus at 12:45, if you are taking an exam the next morning. As alwaysplease remember to sign out when leaving campus early for any reason. If you have two exams on the same day, you may be excused for the entire day prior to the exams. Also, if you are taking a Monday morning exam, you are NOT excused from Friday afternoon classes. That would be silly. Besides, we have an assembly Friday afternoon. For seniors, the last day you are expected to attend each class is Friday, 10 Mayorthe day of the AP Exam if that class has an AP before 10 May. Senior exams for non-AP Courses will take place during the week of May 13  17. To accommodate the AP exam schedule, these exam times should be arranged with your teacher. Teachers may opt to waive the exam if a senior has an A- or better average for the second semester. However, teachers CAN give you an exam even if your grade is an A+. All teachers must give an exam if your second semester grade is below an A-. Good luck to all this week and next and next.As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I thought I had written my last YLT for the year, but I was so impressed by what I saw last week that I needed to share one last email.After seeing our seniors graduate and commence the next stages of their life journey, l spent last week dropping in on our various Capstone experiences and marveling at some of the amazing and wonderful activities I saw. And all week I had the opening lines of Samuel Johnsons poem, The Vanity of Human Wishes running through my head:Let observation with extensive view, Survey mankind, from China to Peru; Remark each anxious toil, each eager strife, And watch the busy scenes of crowded life;This past week at DA was full of busy scenes, and we had students visit China and Peru and so much more. We met the mayor of Durham and documentarians and farmers and chefs and Shakespeare scholars and artists and illustrators and coaches and ESPN commentators and judges and engineersthe list goes on. We had students stand on the Great Wall of China and trek the Incan trail to Machu Pichu and march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We dove deep into comics and video games and grabbed power tools and farm implements and made ourselves and our community better for our efforts.So before we end this year, I wanted to say a heartfelt thank you. Thank you to Kelly Teagarden who did much of the heavy lifting and helped turn a mad scheme into a reality. Thank you to Alison Mattox who performed yeomans work in making sure not just our international trips but all our ventures away from campus were conducted with the safety of our students at the fore. Thank you to every member of our school-wide community that embraced the capstone experience and proposed and designed the myriad offerings this week. The richness of our offerings is due solely to their imagination and effort. Thanks to all the faculty and staff that brought these concepts to life by enduring broiling heat and long drives and frolicsome youths to allow these experiences to unfold. Thanks to the parents who patiently completed the tidal waves of forms that were necessary to make these Capstones happen. Thank you especially to the students who brought the energy and spirit to these adventureswho built robots and made strawberry jam and brought Shakespeare to life and walked in the steps of Incans, and Emperors and Civil Rights leaders.What an inspirational way to close the year. Until Augustlaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to the start of another exciting school year. For those of you new to the Upper School, you should know I spend a little time each Sunday putting together some thoughts and some calendar details that afford you a peek at the week ahead. My goal is to address the issues that affect our community and clarify any confusion about the week by presenting the schedule in broad strokes. This is your go to resource for whats happening at the upper schooland all you have to do is open your mail. Questions are always welcome and gentle corrections will be humbly acknowledged.As you can imagine, faculty, staff and administrators have been working throughout the summer to prepare our campus and our courses for the challenges that await. We are excited to have students return to campus and have made every effort to ensure that our campus remains safe. These efforts are only effective if we are all working from the same script/playbook, and our work is supplemented by your efforts at home and your compliance with ourCommunity Health Compact.Please note that if families have not indicated their agreement for each DA student, their student will not be permitted to attend on-campus classes, activities or events (beginning Aug. 23). We are committed to keeping our campus safe, and we greatly appreciate your cooperation.Life will look a little different on campus as we start the year, but if our experience last year taught us anything, it is that our health protocols work to prevent transmission and preserve the time we spend together in person. And to make sure we have this time together, we must all do our part to keep everyone safe.Our protocols will not be dissimilar from those of last Spring:Masks are to be worn at all times indoors. We will also require masks outdoors in situations where social distancing (minimum 3 feet) is not possible. Students will be allowed to remove masks during lunch, but please note that we will be eating lunch outside whenever the weather permits.All other eating and drinking will need to take place outdoors and socially distanced. Our schedule provides for many breaks during the day for those worried about hydration and/or hunger.Students that fail to adhere to mask wearing policies will be gently corrected. Repeated infractions will result in a students being sent home.For large indoor gatherings, we will observe a 50% capacity (allowing at least one empty seat between audience members).We will require the siblings of students experiencing COVID-like symptoms and awaiting testing results to stay home. If a parent receives a positive COVID diagnosis, children will need to stay home. If a parent develops a COVID-like symptom, contacthealth@da.org immediately to determine whether children need to stay home.We will begin the school year with these policies in place and will continually reassess them and adjust as necessary and possible throughout the year.For our Open House on Monday, August 23, we ask that you attendonly if you and your child(ren) can answer each of the following questions appropriately. We will use these same screening questions for all pre-approved campus visitors and volunteers this fall. Though we willnotbe requiring families to check-in daily using the SaferTogether app this year, we expect that students who cannot answer these questions appropriately will stay home.Are you exhibiting any of the following symptoms: new or worsening cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever of 100.4 or higher, chills, new loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea?Have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last 14 days?Have you been in close contact in the last 14 days with anyone confirmed to have COVID-19 or anyone with symptoms consistent with COVID-19?Do you agree to abide by DA campus rules (wear a mask indoors and outdoors, social distance, wash hands)?For Cavalier Kickoff, you should all have received an email from your respective Lead Class Advisors about next weeks schedule. Students will be participating in a variety of on-campus and off-campus activities to prepare them for the year ahead. You can learn more about Cavalier Kickoff for your class here:Grade 9 scheduleGrade 10 scheduleGrade 11 scheduleGrade 12 scheduleOn Friday, 27 August we will kick off the academic year with our Convocation schedule and commence our regular schedule on Monday, 30 August. We are excited to start this new year with all of our students on campus. We will face some challenges, but we will do so with determination and care and grace.We will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait at least three feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

We are committed to keeping our campus safe, and we greatly appreciate your cooperation.To help explain what campus will look like this year and clarify the many protocols we will follow, I made the following video for our students. I share it as a general source of information for parents, students and faculty alike. Life will look a little different on campus as we start the year, but if the closing of campus in March taught us anything, it is that school is so much more that class time, and the time we spend together needs to be preserved and appreciated. And to make sure we have this time together, we must all do our part to keep everyone safe.As far as the week ahead goes, you should all have received an email from your respective lead class advisors about next weeks schedule. Students will be participating in a variety of on-campus and virtual activities to prepare them for the year ahead. On Friday, we will hold our first day of classes in a virtual format. We will use our flex schedule so that all classes can meet and students can see their teachers and learn about their classes. You can find all the information you need about the week ahead here:Grade 9 scheduleGrade 10 scheduleGrade 11 scheduleGrade 12 scheduleOn Monday, 31 August we will commence our hybrid model with our Block 1 schedule and our A group on campus. We are excited to kick off this new year with all of our students, both our remote and on campus learners. We will face some challenges, but we will do so with determination and care and grace.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

This first week together has been a powerful one of highs and lows. Our recent days has been filled with laughter and tears, joy and sadness, meeting new folks and comforting old friends, but the quality that has been omnipresent throughout this week has been kindness. Students, teachers, parents have all come to together to offer love and support, and I can think of no better example of living the mission driven life. The words Moral, Happy, Productive are more than a brand; they represent our aspirations as a school. This week I saw empathy and kindness and integrity and responsibility and courage everywhere I looked on campus. So thanks to everyone in the community for all the love you have shared.As Monday arrives and classes begin in earnest, we will see something approaching normal. We will, however, all move at our own pace, so continue to be patient with yourselves and one another. Some of us will never be our old selves, and that is okay. The important thing is that we are here for each other. I was overwhelmed by the way our community rallied together this week, and even in our sadness, it was comforting to see so many of you at the service on Saturday. Please look out for one another and know that, you are surrounded by people who care deeply about your wellbeing. Last week we worked and played and consoled together. This week we will compete and learn and explore together. As we transition to the school year proper, lets all work to keep kindness as our guiding light throughout the year.As always and especially this weeklaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to the first full week of classes. I hope everyone had a great time last week. I enjoyed getting to meet many members of the Class of 2022. Iwas also able to hear an impressive group of seniors offer ideas for actively engaging in the Durham community: ideas I hope they will share at Thursdays assembly. And the speeches by Donovan, Emily, Seb, Quinn and Mr. Beck at Fridays convocation made me especially proud my community (sorry, Emily). I hope all of your experiences were equally rewarding in their own ways.As we return to classes I hope everyone is ready to hit the ground running. The coming weeks will afford myriad opportunities to build on the skills you honed last week, to take that first step toward your goals for the year, and to grow your world view and expand yourhorizons. In fact, the coming weeks are dedicated toGetting to know Durham Academy"getting to know thepeoplehere and theopportunitiesavailable. I encourage all of us to use this new beginning with its new spaces and new faces to meet people and explore interests (new and old)to stretch beyond the comfortable and the routineto discover a passionto pursue your time at the upper school deliberately.Next weeks assembly will provide a wonderful opportunity to explore connections and interests. If you plan on leading a club, please have your paperwork completed and submitted to Mr. Klein by the end of this week. Be ready to sample the varied offerings at the Club Fair as you sign up for clubs and load up on sweets. Clubs are a great way to share or discover a passion, meet new folks or come together to make the world a better place. Join early and often. Other opportunities will emerge in the coming weeks. Would you like to audition for the play this Monday after school? Would you like to meet someone from Spain or travel abroad? Perhaps one of the service clubs will speak to you? Maybe you would like to start an Affinity Group? Go all in for Sprit Week? Learn about STEM fields? Bust a strange new dance move at the student dance? Opportunities abound.Good luck this week as we settle in to our regular academic rotation (Monday is Day 1). Also, please add Wednesdays Fire Drill to your calendar. Things might get a little chaotic, but, consistent with this years theme, we will respond to the chaos with patience and generosity.And finally, a little lesprit de lescalier (i.e., how I intended to end convocation)Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

It was great to see our students back on campus last week after so many months away. Cavalier Kick Off was an important opportunity to reconnect with old friends, meet new ones, and familiarize ourselves with the new campus protocols. It was a lot to take in in a few short days, so we will continue to offer reminders and gentle corrections and lots of support as we navigate a safe return to the classroom. On Friday, all of our students were able to attend every one of their classes, meeting their teachers and learning about the year ahead. We also held our annual Convocation (albeit in a new format) and, more importantly, our Student Government Ice Cream Social!We are still unable to gather in Kenan as a full school, so we gathered by advisory to watch Convocation broadcast on our classroom monitors. We plan to use this same format for our Morning Meetings this year, the first of which will be aired live from our new studio desk in the Learning Commons. We are very excited to take advantage of our technology and our creativity to work around the limitations imposed by COVID. We continue to find ways to reimagine our traditional programs in new and exciting ways. I look forward to Mondays Morning Meeting Live with our hosts Dean Lindy Frasher and Student Government President Henry Rogers.Convocation itself was a simple affair this year. I was the only speaker and we started with a few reminders about our COVID protocols. We are trying to keep everyone safe with a few straightforward rules. I am sharing them again here, and we will continue to remind students and reinforce these standards in the coming weeks. You must wear your mask indoors at all times. Lunch will be the only exception, but until the weather prevents us from being out of doors, we will eat and drink outside and wear our masks inside.You must remain at least three feet apart at all times. This means we have to limit the seating at out picnic tables to four persons (one on each bench). When outside, you may remove your mask if you are alone or if you are seated and more than three feet apart. We did a great job at lunch on Friday following these basic rules, and I anticipate these practices becoming fully engrained as we readjust to school life.The bulk on Convocation was a call to each student to find their personal mission at Durham Academy. I shared a little history of our schools attempt to articulate our mission, from 1963s four flames of learning to our current portrait of a graduate. I also shared some concrete ways the school is working to achieve these lofty goal: revised handbook policies for dress code and sexual misconduct, adding a Dean and a Learning Coach, and altering our schedule to provide more time for deeper learning and a more manageable workload. But most importantly, I posed the following three questions for all of our students:Why are you at Durham Academy?Who do you want to be this year? What are you going to do to make it happen?If you have a moment, I encourage you to explore your answers together. Having a clear sense of purpose can be a real motivating factor in striving to become your best self.Heres to a great week ahead. We will continue to wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

On Friday, all of our students were able to attend all of their classes, meeting their teachers and learning about the year ahead. We also held our virtual Convocation, and I would like to take one more opportunity to thank our speakers, Daniel Park, Bonnie Wang, Paul Slack and Jazmin Garcia-Smith. Your stories are powerful and important, and your bravery and honesty help lead the school towards a better future. Thank you, all.Last week provided myriad opportunities to observe how our plans are made manifest in the light of reality. As we navigate our return to campus we will invariably meet some obstacles and need to fine tune our procedures. More than once last week I thought to myself, I feel like Leiningen versus the ants. This was rendered literal when several faculty members reported hordes of ants under our newly installed tents. I quickly added ants to the list of unforeseen problems necessitating a swift remedy. This is an ever evolving list, but our amazing maintenance crew used Fridays remote day to treat the infested areas, and hopefully we will be able to move forward ant free. But ants or no, I still keep coming back to Leiningen.If you are unfamiliar with Leiningen versus the Ants you can read it here. (Be warned there are spoilers ahead, so pause now and give it a read if you like.) It is a short story, originally written in German (Leiningens Kampf mit den Ameisen"), and rewritten in English by the author, Carl Stephenson. They even made a film about it with Charlton Heston called The Naked Jungle (a title I found disappointingly misleading as a teen). The original recounts the story of a South American estate owner who seeks to defend his farmstead from twenty square miles of life destroying ants. I first read the story when I was very young and fond of the horror genre. The first book I ever purchased was at a school book fair: a collection of Edgar Allen Poes Tales of Terror. I would sit for hours and consume the cheap pulp collections of tales of suspense, and it was in just such a moldy paperback, one of the Alfred Hitchcock Presents series, where I first encountered Leiningen.The basic premise of the story is the classic tale of man versus nature. Leiningen, when told to flee the all-consuming horde of soldier ants, invokes his lifelong motto: the human brain needs to only be fully aware of its powers to conquer the elements. So while others run, he fortifies his estate to repel the ants. His first defense is a water filled moat, twelve feet wide, that he inundates with water using a dam on the river. He also has a backup plan, an inner moat, that while smaller, can be filled with petrol and set ablaze to hold back the swarm. Eventually, however, his petrol running low, he relies on his last resort, a desperate two mile dash on foot through the ants to open the damn, flood the estate, and wash all the invaders down river. The ants are defeated, and Leiningen emerges victorious with a body that seemed almost one open wound or as he so cavalierly puts it, a bit streamlined. Man, at least in this account, wins out over nature.Like the titular hero, we are also facing a tiny threat that is both relentless and insatiable. We have worked all summer to devise a plan to keep our students, faculty and staff safe while on campus. Where Leiningen had a moat of water, we have masks and social distancing and hand hygiene and outdoor classes. Where Leiningen had a fallback plan and an inner moat of petrol, we are working on a revised hybrid model that limits time on campus but keeps some in person activities. We value our time together on campus and know it makes a difference for all of us. We will fight to preserve this time together. And finally where Leiningen opens the damn to flood the estate, we have our fallback plan of Durham E-cademy where everything is virtual.The lessons I take from Leiningen are varied. Nature, be it ants or viruses, is unyielding and not to be underestimated. We can erect protective barriers, but we must remain vigilant. This requires all of us to honor the Community Health Compact and abide by the campus protocols. We must also be mindful of hubris, somehow thinking that we alone are immune to the laws of nature. I have read enough Greek drama and the Book of Proverbs to know that pride goeth before a fall. We need only look at what is happening here in Chapel Hill to provide a cautionary tale. We must respect the elements. Viruses and ants do not compromise.Sowe will face tomorrow with honesty, vigilance, trust and effort. We will know when to surrender ground. And we will follow best practices to keep our community safe.We will always wear masks indoors.We will always practice social distancing.We will wash our hands like we are preparing for surgery.We will keep an eye out for ants.Tomorrow we commence our hybrid model with our Block schedule. On Monday and Tuesday our A group will be on campus and B group remote. If you have forgotten which group you are in you can check here. We are excited to kick off this new year knowing we will face some challenges, but we will do so with determination and care and grace.Now more than everLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope this long weekend is proving a tonic for your first full week of school. I know many of you have your first major assessments in the coming weeks, so plan your time wisely. The calendar below is there to help you see ahead in order to best manage the workload. We will be spending some time this year looking at that workload and implementing some concrete ways we can make the best use of our class time and homework expectations. The ever elusive balance is the white whale of the modern world, and I am the monomaniacal Ahab, always in pursuit. When school resumes on Tuesday, I expect we will all start to settle into some comfortable routines. I know the traffic in both the morning and the afternoon has been a bit chaotic, but that always resolves itself, especially when student drivers start arriving a little later. Parents, you can help by using Kenan lot for drop off and pick up (a left exit from the Kirby Gym lot can be frustrating in the morning). I also recommend a 3:30 pick up in the afternoon. By then most of the traffic has dissipated. As always, your patience is appreciated.Although I shared this a few years ago when our current seniors were new to the upper school, I figure it might be worth a revisit. Inspired by our own student speeches for This I Believe, I came across my manifesto as I was thinking about my goals for the year. These statements represent an articulation of my vision for the Upper School and a delineation of my values and guiding principles. I may not always achieve the ideal, but these beliefs drive my efforts and my expectations1) I believe in hard work. I do not always relish it, but I believe it is the bedrock of good citizenship. 2) I believe that family is the most important thing in the world. I also believe that we are a family and we are at our best when we are helping each other survive the mundane and the momentous. 3) I believe that every student deserves our best effort. The rude, the quirky, the disinterested, the unlovable should never be dismissed. Once upon a time I was that student.4) I believe good citizenship starts with empathy.5) I believe in appropriate candor. We are all better off when someone tells us we have spinach in our teethmyself included.6) I believe in service. We all have a responsibility to leave a place better than we found it.7) I believe I will make mistakes and I will learn from those mistakes and I will be a better person for the experience.8) I believe difficult conversations should be conducted face to face. This can be awkward and unsettling, but it is the best way forward.9) I believe that communication is essential, that miscommunication is inevitable and that patience is the most valuable tool we have.10) I believe in schedulesand flexibility.11) I believe that meanness is the creeping crud of any community and candor and collegiality are the best disinfectants.12) I believe change is both scary and necessary. We all must be willing to learn and growto lean into the uncomfortableto find that zone between complacency and terror where we grow as individuals.13) I believe I am extraordinarily lucky to have this job and will do my best to lead the upper school in accordance with these beliefs.Thanks for taking the time out of your Sunday to read this. If you have a moment, I encourage you to sit down and write your manifesto. What do you value? What do you want this next year to look like? How are you going to be the change you want to see in the world? Put it on paper and make it so.As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are all well and making the most of this weekend. The weather is a little drier and a little cooler, and Saturday proved to be both beautiful and sobering. For yesterday marked the 20th anniversary of the attacks that took place on 11 September 2001, attacks that cost the lives of over 3000 people in New York, in Arlington and in Pennsylvania. Like many folks who are old enough, I remember so much about that day. I was teaching in Connecticut at the time, and we had several students who had family members working in the World Trade Center. I remember vividly sitting with one young woman whose father died that day. At the time she did not know anything for certain, but her fear and her confusion and her suffering were all compounded by the uncertainty. When I think of 9/11, I think of this young woman and her loss and her tears, but also her resiliency as over the years we have kept in touch and I have watched her work tirelessly to honor her father by combatting the ignorance and hatred that lead to and resulted from the attacks of 9/11.As I watched yesterdays ceremonies, Presidents Biden, Obama and Clinton attending the reading of the names of those who died at the National September 11 Memorial in New York and President Bush speaking in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, I was moved by President Bushs recognition that violence and extremism, not nations or religions, are the true threat to our values:We have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers withinThere is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home, but in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our continuing duty to confront them.As we remember our losses, let us follow President Bushs advice and commit to confronting violence and extremism and bigotry in all their forms. Let us commit to caring for those around us and celebrating our diversity and rejecting hatred. As we recognize our loss and our grief, let us commit to making our world a more accepting and forgiving place.Closer to home, Autumn is, mercifully, just around the corner, and the end of 90-degree days has to be in sight. On Tuesday evening, we will hold our somewhat misleadingly titled Back to School Night. Since this years event will be virtual, parents will receive a link Tuesday afternoon to a welcoming video from Leora Fields, (President of the Parents Association) and me (Director of the Upper School). Advisors will set up a Teams meeting (for parents of their advisees) to run from 7:00-7:20 p.m. This will be a chance for advisors to (re)introduce themselves and talk about the year ahead. After meeting with advisors, you may visit your students classes through the magic of Veracross where you will find brief videos from each teacher introducing themselves and giving some general insights into the classes.For those of us attuned to the academic calendar, Back to School Night always marks the point when we have left the start of school behind and find ourselves wading into the thick of it all. The luster of the new school year starts to fade and the reality of the work that lies ahead jumps into focus. It is important that as we shift into a higher scholastic gear we take the time to remind ourselves of those things that make life good.For the coming week, please note that we will be out of school on Thursday forYom Kippur, and Friday is another day set aside for no homework or tests.Heres to a successful week ahead. We will continue to care for one another by wearing our masks, waiting at least three feet apart, washing our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are all well. It has been a beautiful weekend. The weather is a little drier and a little cooler than the sauna we had for Parents Night. Autumn is, mercifully, just around the corner, and the end of 90-degree days has to be in sight. For those of us attuned to the academic calendar, Parents Night always marks the point when we have left the start of school behind and find ourselves smack dab in the thick of it all. The luster of the new school year starts to fade and the reality of the work that lies ahead jumps into focus. It is important that as we shift into a higher scholastic gear we take the time to remind ourselves of those things that make life good.Whenever I ask myself what is best in life, I am immediately reminded of one of my favorite bad movies, Conan the Barbarian.This 1982 classic (I was a junior in high school) stars a young Arnold Schwarzenegger who was cast primarily for his resemblance to the titular hero and in spite of his very limited acting skills.I likere-watchingthis film more for its camp value than any cinematic worth.They do a fine job of capturing the pulp fiction aspects of Robert E. Howards original stories from the 1930s.Having watched this movie multiple times with my son, he and I have memorized many of the lines.A favorite one takes place in a yurt where the question is posed, What is best in life?A brave warrior asserts: The open steppe, a fleet horse, falcons at your wrist, and the wind in your hair.To which the general replies: Wrong!He poses the question to Conan who knows the true answer:To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women!My son and I reenact this scene regularly at family dinners much to the chagrin of my wife and daughter.Conans response, his first spoken lines in the movie, might seem suitable for a graduate of the Hyrkanian fighting pits, but I am a greater admirer of the wrong answer: The open steppe, a fleet horse, falcons at your wrist, and the wind in your hair. Although I have a perfectly reasonable case of equinophobia, the idea of being in nature and owning a falcon seems pretty cool. Of course, if you pressed me, I would be more likely to go along with Socrates, who, when asked what is best in life, said education, virtue, and the investigation of the unknown.These are the notions that tend to lead one on a path to becoming an Upper School Director. I spent most of my time in high school confused by the world around me and the people in it. I could not fathom how others thought and acted. I could not tell if people were motivated by the same thoughts and fears that drove me. So I did what I thought was best in life: I read books and I studied others. I saw literature as a window into the human condition, and I read vociferously. At NCSSM I took my first Philosophy class and started down that path of human exploration. At Duke I tried out Psychology and gained another toehold in my assault on understanding. I spent thirteen (13) years in college seeking answers from books, from professors, from classmates and peers. Thirty years ago, I started teaching as a graduate student and found I learned more as a teacher than I ever did as a student. I discovered that teaching made me happy. More often than not I left the classroom energized and excited. So, yeah, I fully believe education, virtue, and the investigation of the unknown make for my good life. Still, having a falcon at my wrist would be awesome.I hope you can carve out some time in your busy schedules to consider your own answers to what is best in life. Too often we can focus on the next step in our journey and forget to consider why we are on that particular journey. Hopefully yours is taking you towards what is best in your life, but you must seek an answer to that question if you are to know.Whatever answer you land upon, I hope you can stilllaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone was able to survive this long, wet weekend with minimal disruption. We at Chez Wilson awoke on Friday morning to a power outage and the loss of internet. It was a mild inconvenience, especially in the face of other damage across the state, and resulted in a very quiet day of reading (a Joe Nesb Norwegian crime thriller for me) and little else. We were worried about the food in the fridge, so my daughter and I made a meal of fish fingers and custard. It was surprisingly not terrible. Power and internet returned on Saturday, so for the rest of the weekend there were no more exotic combinations from the fridge. From a DA perspective, the week ahead looks promising, both academically and meteorologically. As Florence makes her way North, we should dry out a bit. The rest of the state will need more time to recover, and our help will certainly be needed moving forward. I imagine several of our service clubs will be mobilizing in the coming weeks to assist with relief efforts, so stay tuned for those announcements. As the year starts to gain momentum, the announcement section of YLT starts to grow, so please take some time to check them out, and, as always, let me know if you want to add anything.For the coming week, we will be out of school on Wednesday for Yom Kippur, and Thursday is another day set aside for no homework or tests. The week after holds a few surprises. Wednesday (9/26) will be the first of several delayed openings this year. Faculty will still arrive at 8:00 am to meet and work on our curriculum mapping. Our college counselors will use that morning to meet with the juniors to initiate college conversations and pre-planning. Classes will start at 10:15, but the Learning Commons and the lobby of Kirby will be open at 7:30 am for those students eager to be at school on the early side. Otherwise, a couple of extra hours of sleep are always good for young people. Spirit week and a rescheduled Parents Night are also on the horizon, but we will talk about that more in next weeks YLT. Please continue to be safe. Florence may have spared us her fury, but there are others in our state who are less fortunate. Please keep those folks in your thoughts and be ready to help if you can. As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are ready! The next fortnight will consist offive(5) school days each week. That is a lot of school time. This will test our focus, our stamina and our mask skills. The first major essay of the year in my Ethics class is due on Friday, and the midway point of first quarter will soon be upon us, soYou mustgird your loinsfor the challenges ahead. Spend a little time today planning and organizing. Try to avoid falling down the rabbit hole that is the interwebs. I tell my family we are all just three clicks away from getting sucked into the matrix. When I searched for the gif, I followed a link to a video montage of battle scenes inGame of Thronesset to Black Sabbaths "War Pigs. Awesome stuff, but also pure distraction. This almost led to following another link and thenYLTwould not be coming out until Sunday night. Resist the temptations, avoid the distractions, focus your efforts.And speaking of getting serious, the time has come to move away from reminders and start the accountability phase of protocol enforcement. At our regular meeting with our Health Experts last week, they all emphasized that we are at our highest risk for Covid transmission when we are unmasked and eating/drinking indoors. Mr. Ulku-Steiner, our Head of School, followed up by urging all administrators to redouble our efforts to eat outside. So here are the protocols once more.<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>You must wear your mask indoors at all times. Lunch will be the only exception, but until the weather forces us to eat in the gym, we will eat and drink outside and wear our masks inside.<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>You must remain at least three feet apart at all times. This means we have to limit the seating at out picnic tables to four persons (one on each bench).<![if !supportLists]> <![endif]>When outside, you may remove your mask if you are alone or if you are seated and more than three feet apart.Please keep your masks on when indoors or we will need to send you home. This is a community standard and requires a community effort. You not only put yourself at risk when you are maskless indoors but also others and our whole endeavor to keep school open and in person. I will be away for the first part of the week, but you are all in good hands. Mrs. Ilijic will be conning the front desk to direct your queries. Mr. Regnerus, Mrs. Frasher and Mr. Gould will be available for support and direction (and making sure you are properly masked). And do not forget to make yourself look good for picture day. We will be stepping away from Maths classes for a few minutes to take pictures, so plan accordingly. Heres to a successful week ahead. We will continue to care for one another by wearing our masks, waiting at least three feet apart, washing our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

The calendar below is there to help you see ahead in order to best manage the workload. We will be spending some time this year looking at that workload and studying ways we can make the best use of our class time and homework expectations. Please note that next Tuesday is one of several no homework days you will find scattered throughout the year. We take seriously the words that define our mission driven life, and you cannot achieve happiness without balance. Speaking of workload, Monday is Labor Day and marks the official end of Hotdog Season. This information comes straight from the NHDSC (National Hotdog and Sausage Council), so you know its true. They are a great resource for all my hotdog and sausage queries. If you are looking for instructions on the proper means of eating a chili dog, you need look no further. You might also want to check out their sister sites for The American Bakers Association and Pickle Packers International. And, yes, you can pickle that.When school resumes on Tuesday, I expect we will all start to settle into some comfortable routines.

I find we are all better served when we use our voices to share our experiences and learn from one another. As always: Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

On Friday evening, many of our families gathered to recognizeRoshHashanah, the start of the Jewish new year. RoshHashanahencourages us to reflect upon our past as we start a new year seeking health and prosperity for ourselves and others.  But Friday evening also brought some very sad news. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg finally succumbed to her years-long battle with cancer. I have admired Justice Ginsberg because she, like Thurgood Marshall before her, fought tirelessly to advance the cause of equality under the law. Whether arguing before the Supreme Court or serving as a member of that esteemed body, she recognized that we can hold to our beliefs, fight for equality and do so without jeopardizing collegiality and civility. Justice Ginsburgs legacy recalls to mind the Hebrew phrasetikkun olamwhich means "world repair." Tikkun olamhas come to represent the idea of social action and the pursuit of social justice,but it also refers to repairs performed on an individual level. We all have a role in making our world and ourselves better. As Justice Ginsberg noted in her dissent to Shelby County v. Holder: The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice, she said, quoting Martin Luther King, Jr. But only, if there is a steadfast commitment to see the task through to completion. As we work to repair the world, to bend the moral arc of the universe, let us do so with patience and understanding and civility. Let Justice Ginsberg inspire you to "Fight for the things that you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you."And speaking of things we care about,Julie Lythcott-Haims spoke powerfully to our students and faculty on Friday about becoming self-sufficient, resilient and successful adults. At the heart of her message to parents and educators: We need to prepare the child for the path instead of the path for the child. And based on their initial response, our students are eager for parents to hear her speak on Wednesday (9/23) at 7:00 pm. For those who would like to do some homework ahead of her presentation, you can watch her address to the students here, and you can find her book,How To Raise an Adult,available for sale at Flyleaf Books.She will share insights on how to find a path that leads to joy and fulfillment and our most authentic selves. And I imagine her presentation will lead to some difficult/complex/candid conversations throughout the week.Heres to a week ahead filled with listening and reflection and working for the things we care about. As we start our week, our academic year, our new year the message of Rosh Hashana and the words of RBG and JLH provide invaluable lessons about introspection and personal action and respect. Wecanmake a difference in the world. Wecantip the scales with a good thought or deed. We can respectfully disagree. Ewe can listen to one another. Let us examine the values we hold dear and work toward goodness and kindness andmitzvahand along the way leave our community and ourselves a little better than we found them.We will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Monday night at 3:50 am my favorite season, Autumn, arrives. I had hoped that last weeks cooler temperatures were here to stay, but the forecast is filled with still more 90 degree days, and thus our endless summer continues. Meanwhile I have a couple of new cardigans from my Mr. Rogers collection that I am hoping to wear, but it looks like I might have to wait until November. At least we have been spared the hurricanes that besieged us last year. Given that the last five years have been the hottest on record and this year is on track to rank among the top three, I am pleased to see our students are taking up the challenge of addressing climate issues. On Friday we had 23 students and two faculty members join the climate strike in Raleigh. I am grateful to these students and all our young people who are taking this issue seriously and working so deliberately towards a more sustainable future by recycling, composting, educating and raising awareness.One of the reasons I feel blessed to be an educator is the opportunity to work with so many young people who are ready and willing to take on the challenges that face our world. Every day I see young people committed to making this planet a better place. Their efforts call to mind Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the scouting movement, who composed a final message to all scouts that he wished to be published upon his death. After a full life he chose to share the following conclusion: "Happiness doesn't come from being rich, nor merely from being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. Although I was never a scout, I always cite Baden-Powell in my Ethics class as one of the guiding principles for my own approach to moral reasoning. It is a simple philosophy really; always try to leave a place just a little better than you found it. Sometimes this means picking up that trash in the LC, even though you did not leave it there. Sometimes it means holding the door for the person behind you. Sometimes it means offering a little empathy to a classmate or stranger that is not having the best day. And sometimes it means saving the worldeven if you are not the one who broke it. Thank you to all the young people who have embraced the challenge, taking on the ills of our world and working to make things better for all of us. You make me hopeful. You make me grateful. And I hope you are finding happiness in your noble, selfless acts.As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope you are ready for a full, and I do mean full, week ahead. It has been a while since we had a five day week, but (If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise) this week looks to be chockfull. Fortunately, the transition will be gentle since Monday kicks off Spirit Week with Pajama Day. Tacky Tuesday will also not pose a challenge for some of you.  (I believe that is what the kids call throwing shade.) The true test will come on Wednesday when you are to dress like a teacher. Good luck finding a monocle.Speaking of Wednesday, this will be our first late start of the year. While most students can get a little much needed sleep, teachers will arrive at the usual time to work on our curriculum mapping. The junior class, alas, will not remain abed. They will use this time (8:30-9:45) to meet with the College Counseling Deans. All others can feel free to arrive on campus late, but please note that the Learning Commons will be open all morning (starting at 7:00 am) for those who need a place to study or await your A period class at 10:15.Parents, this will also be a busy week for you. Parents of juniors will visit campus on Monday night to meet with our college counselors and hear more about the college process. Thursday will see all our parents here for Parents Night. This is a chance to chat with advisors, take a brief tour of your students schedules and put a face to all those teacher names that, I hope, occasionally pop up if your child is willing to answer that oft repeated question: How was school today?Friday will be the culmination of our Spirit Week with our all school pep rally in Kirby and Homecoming throughout the afternoon and evening. I will be dressed in my finest Green and White and look forward to attending the alumni event and checking in on all the games. It should be a great evening to celebrate what it means to be a member of the Durham Academy community.As we anticipate Homecoming and taking to the fields and courts that just last Monday were inundated with 3+ feet of water, we need to also remember our fellow North Carolinians who are still struggling with recovery efforts from Hurricane Florence. While our maintenance crew worked diligently last week to clean the track and tennis courts, and our cross country members brought rakes to practice to clear the trails, other schools down east remained closed as flood waters continued to rise. To lend a hand to our fellow Tar Heels, we will be collecting items for hurricane relief throughout the next fortnight. Stay tuned for an announcement at Morning Meeting tomorrow and follow up emails from student leaders who are spearheading our efforts. We were lucky to be spared the brunt of the hurricanes force, so it falls to us to help lift our neighbors, recognizing that we are all in this together.That is a lot to pack into one week, but we will rise to the challengesin the classroom, on the athletic fields and in our community.As always, but especially this week:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Something happened rather quietly after school let out on Wednesday. While we were all scrambling to keep dry, Autumn arrived (at precisely 3:22 p.m. EDT, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory). This morning, I am writing YLT while sitting under a hickory tree that clearly understands what this means and wants to be the first to shed its foliage. It is a beautiful morning here in Chapel Hillcool, with a light breeze that sends down a shower of leaves every time it passes through the canopy. We turned off our AC last week and had our first fire of the season Thursday night. As In the words of Lucy Maud Montgomery: I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.The arrival of Autumn also means that Hispanic Heritage Month is in full swing. Every year from September 15 - October 15, we take an opportunity to celebrate the histories, cultures, and contributions of American citizens whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean as well as Central and South America.Our Diversity, Equity & Engagement coordinators have provided books and resources for our classrooms so that our students can learn more about the diversity within theHispaniccommunity and the many positive ways these individuals contribute to the richness of American society.We also acknowledge that this exploration can and should extend beyond this particular month of celebration. As we continue to examine the diversity woven into the fabric of our communities, please do not hesitate to reach out and share with us any resources or experiences you think might be of interest to others. As always, we appreciate your partnership in these efforts.We have another full week before us, so I hope you are ready. Please check out all the opportunities to engage in our community in the Announcement section below. There are lots of ways to make a difference.Heres to a successful week ahead. We will continue to wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, while we stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

It was so nice to see the sun again this morning after a very wet Friday and an overcast Saturday. I still rely on a little sun therapy to elevate my mood and recharge my constitutional batteries. I have even carved out time for a very long walk for Monday. This long weekend has been a welcome break from the daily grind. It is vital that we recognize that every member of our community has been operating on overdrive as we navigate this new school order, but I want to take a little time this morning to thank our faculty who have been at the forefront of this effort to make on campus learning possible.Our teachers gave up large chunks of their summer to prepare for the challenges of this year. All of our faculty attended workshops and webinars over the summer to prepare for virtual classrooms, and they are currently revising and reinventing those lessons to meet the needs of teaching in a hybrid mode. Combining virtual learners with students who are physically in the classroom has been an ambitious endeavor, and all the pedagogy experts agree that it is the most complicated approach. Words like synchronous and asynchronous have replaced traditional notions of class time and homework. Our familiarity with new technologies has quadrupled since the Spring. It is a new frontier in education, and we are still working on the right balance even as we move through the daily work of teaching, assessing and supporting our students. I remain grateful to our teachers who continue to go above and beyond in their work this year. Everything now takes twice as long, and much of what we are doing is at the forefront of educational practices. Our faculty continues to meet together to share best practices, to refine lessons and assessments, to make this grand experiment work for our students.So thank you, teachers. Your hard work is inspirational, and school cannot happen without the many invisible hours that you spend preparing lessons, grading student work, writing college recommendations and attending to the social emotional needs of your charges. Your labor makes all this possible, and Durham Academy is a special place because of all of you.We will continue do our best to make this year meaningful for all of our constituents, and we will continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, wait six feet apart, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Its SPIRT WEEK! So check your cynicism at the door and lets have some fun! We will take a break from school on Monday to recognize Rosh Hashanah, and I encourage you all to spend a little time taking stock of your life and considering your goals for the future. Rosh Hashanah encourages us to reflect upon our past as we start a new year seeking health and prosperity for ourselves and others. As we start our week, our academic year, our new yearthis is a great time to focus on introspection and reflection and community. Together we can make a difference in the world. We can tip the scales with a good thought or deed. Let us examine the values we hold dear and work toward goodness and kindness together. Because of Rosh Hashanah, there are no assignments due nor are there any quizzes or tests on Tuesday, so there are no excuses not to embrace the spirit of the week. I have posted the themes and activities in the fortnight schedule below so everyone can dress appropriately. This means wacky (but still dress-code appropriate) attire and an even wackier schedule on Friday. I am convinced this is the year the 9th graders will reign supreme. I have heard several seniors talk about their trepidation about retaining the Sprit Week crown. The suspense this year is palpable. Please carve out some time this week to support your respective class during the activities. Try to find that right balance between competitiveness and sportsmanship and community spirit. Cheaters only cheat themselves as my mother likes to say. For Fridays pep rally, please be respectful of your younger schoolmates when they visit Kirby Gym. We are here to celebrate the best of DA, and the young ones look up to you upper schoolers. Show them what school spirit looks like. Try not to intimidate or scare them. They will be sitting in your seats someday, so be good role models. I hope everyone can stick around after school on Friday to show some love for our athletic teams. I plan on spending some time at each game and as well as our alumni reception. One of the great things about attending DA is the chance to feel part of something bigger than yourself. We are all part of a community that will last beyond graduation. Lets celebrate that community this week.Go Cavs!As alwayslaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

You may be unawares, but something happened rather quietly last Saturday. While we were looking forward to Spirit Week, Autumn arrived (at precisely 9:54 p.m. EDT on 22 September, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory). The autumnal equinox is one of my favorite days of the year because it presages a shift in the weathera promise that humid days will soon be behind us, replaced with the cool, crisp air of October. For those who follow a non-meteorological calendar, October means that interim reports will be sent home this week, pumpkin spice has made its much anticipated return, a bowl of candy corn mysteriously appeared on my coffee table, and next Monday we have Fall Breakall sure signs ofthe season. AsI have said before, this is my favorite time of year. It suits my color palettegive me dark greens and browns any day over garish jewel tones or washed out pastels. Let me put on a beige cardigan and all is right with the world.October is also a very busy time of year. SATs will be offered on Saturday. Only eighteen school days remain in the first quarter. College applications loom on the horizon. There would seem to be too much work and not enough time. Careful planning is the only way to make it through, so pay attention to the schedule and announcements below, plan wisely and prepare to work hard. I recommend a color coded calendar to keep track of everything. You might want to schedule a little down time in your week. Put down the screens, step away from the homework for a few minutes. A nice walk among the falling leaves and some quiet reflection will do the trick. Self care can go a long way towards helping you manage your work load and growing into your best self.The autumnal equinox also calls to mind one of my favorite figures from the history of science. Did you know that Tycho Brahe discovered that the time between the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox was approximately seven days longer than the time between the autumn and spring equinoxes? This proved to be a significant discovery because it profoundly changed the worlds understanding of planetary orbits. And he did it all without a telescope. From his castle-observatory in Uraniborg on the tiny island of Hven, he spent many a sleepless night observing the heavens with a quadrant and a sextant. Through patience and investigation he made meticulous observations that became the foundation for new understandings of the universe. His assistant, Johannes Kepler, used Brahes observations as the basis for his laws of planetary motion which in turn shaped Newtons laws of motion and universal gravitation. So when you think of Autumn, spill a little cider for Tycho Brahe who understood that the truth is out there if we are willing to set aside our preconceptions and prejudices to spend the time necessary to investigate the universe and let the facts guide us toward the truth. Also, he lost his nose in a duel and had a pet moose that liked beer, meaning Tycho Brahe is Danish for totally hardcore.Welcome to October.As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Last week was a wonderful start to our academic year. We were able to get our first full week of classes under our belts, and the campus was brimming with lots of positive energy. We managed to make it through lunch on Wednesday before the rains came (much to the delight of Deans Frasher and Gould), and the suggestion of fall like temperatures on Thursday and Friday reminded us that the sultry days of summer will soon be over.This week, we will take a break from school on Monday to celebrate Labor Day and all the hardworking Americans who put in the long hours to build this nation. I want to offer a special shout out to Peter J. McGuire for making this long weekend possible. On Tuesday, we will recognizeRosh Hashanah and the start of a new year.Rosh Hashanahencourages us to reflect upon our past as we transition into a new beginning, seeking health and prosperity for ourselves and others. As we start our week, our academic year, our new yearthis is a great time to focus on introspection and reflection and community. Together we can make a difference in the world. We can tip the scales with a good thought or deed. Let us examine the values we hold dear and work toward goodness and kindness together. And if you are having trouble determining how best to get started, Fridays Club Fair is a great way to meet new folks and find some meaningful activities that will make our community, if not the world, a better place. This week is the week to get started on that good year.And speaking of hard work and new beginnings, I also want to take this opportunity to introduce you to our upper school administrative assistant, Alexa Ilijic. Mrs. Ilijic replaces Mrs. Evans who retired over the summer, and she has been a most welcome addition to our front office in the Learning Commons. She has already helped many of you with driving certificates and parking passes and signing out. She is also the person to contact (alexa.ilijic@da.org) if your child is going to be absent from school. And please do keep sick students at home as set out in theCOVID-19 Addendum to the All-School Handbook. Guidelines for When to Stay Home are on pages 8-10. Policies related to Returning to School are on pages 10-13.If you are uncertain about a policy please contacthealth@da.org.Looking ahead, please note that Tuesday (9/14) is our Back to School Night, which this year is a bit of a misnomer since it will be virtual. As we seek to minimize risks and keep our school open, we have made the difficult choice to limit some of our usual events, especially those that involve large numbers. I will have more details next week, but, in general, we will be offering a Back to School Night that looks very similar to last years event with teacher videos that you can watch at your leisure.Heres to a short, successful week ahead. We will continue to wear our masks, wait at least three feet apart, wash our hands, and stillLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I awoke Saturday morning to something different in the air. The humidity and the heat that weighed so heavily on us last week seemed to have loosed their hold. And while it is still a few weeks away on the calendar and even further in reality, it felt like Autumn was saying hello and just letting us know that the dog days of August were soon to be a faded, sweaty memory. Saturday had a very back-to-school feeling and made me appreciate all the heavy lifting everyone in our community has done to make it possible for all of us to actually get back on campus. Last week was exciting and exhausting and a great reminder of how valuable our time together can be. We learned a lot during our first week of classes about our schedule, our students and ourselves. Overall, our return to campus was a success, but we have some areas for improvement that we will address with a few tweaks.Check InStudent arrival went surprisingly well last week. We were well staffed with parent and faculty volunteers (thank you!), and we learned much about numbers and traffic. With our Lower and Preschool moving to 100% next week, there is likely to be a bit more congestion during drop off, so we are making a few adjustments. We will consolidate our check in stations to two locations: Kenan and Kirby. All sophomore drivers and all parent drop offs will check in at the front of Kenan Auditorium. This will allow us to move the car line away from Ridge Road and cut down on some of the staffing needs. Junior and senior drivers will all now check in at the entrance to Kirby Gymnasium. Check-in remains from 7:40-8:10 a.m. Late arrivals will still check in at the front office with Mrs. Evans. All students must go through the check in process when they arrive on campus.If you can, pleasevolunteer to assistwith check ins on a morning or two in the coming weeks.SchedulesThe biggest issue that arose this week involved unstructured time for our students. Keeping the appropriate social distance requires more practice by our students and more oversight by our faculty. The times we felt most vulnerable were primarily during Tutorial and on Block 2 & 4 when classes ended earlier. In order to address this immediately, we are moving to a model where Tutorial is shifted to an extended period on Block 4 that could be either virtual or face-to-face. The Tutorial time for Blocks 1 & 3 will remain unchanged. The morning tutorial slot will be replaced with Advisory. Advisories will still meet twice a week, but both will take place when the advisory is on campus. (Thus, A group advisories will meet on Blocks 1 & 2, but not meet on Blocks 3 & 4.)We will also institute a study hall for students that remain on campus on Block 2 & 4 in the 1:55-3:15 time slot. We are working on a sign up protocol to share early this week (most likely Tuesday) that will permit parents to register their students for these proctored study halls. Students may leave campus when they have fulfilled their academic obligations, but all students that are on campus after 1:55 on Block 2 & 4 will be assigned to a proctored study hall. Student clubs will have virtual meetings after school or face-to-face on campus if the club advisor is present.

Students can expect to have their picture taken during their English class on the day they are on campus. Those students who are fully virtual will receive an email with a link that will allow them to sign up for a time on Friday 9/18. This is a Flex Day, so the only students on campus will be those who sign up to be photographed.Thats enough for this week. Please look for emails in the coming days to sign up for Study Halls. Keep practicing the big three: wear a mask, keep socially distant and wash your hands. I hope you are able to make the most of this beautiful long weekend toLaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

I hope everyone has enjoyed this beautiful weekend. Hurricane Dorian spared our area any real harm, and we can be grateful for our safety and the fact that we did not miss any school. I know how much you all hate missing school, so we try to use the best data available to make smart choices about school closing. Whether it is hurricane panic or snow fever, we try to make these decisions based on scientific forecasts rather than the alarmist predictions that can take over the rumor mill during weather events. Your safety is foremost, but we will always opt to keep school open if that is a safe and reasonable option. Speaking of other school decisions that can be unpopularseveral of you have made inquiries recently about lockers, so I thought I would explain a little history about the decision to forego lockers at the upper school. In the long time agowhen the architects and school leaders imagined the new upper school campus, the decision was made to abandon traditional lockers. This is a nationwide trend in schools, and there has been declining usage at DA over the years. This usage assessment grows out of actual counts of the lockers being used by the students here at DA. When Mrs. Frasher and I last did a count, DA only had about 200 lockers and only about 1 in 3 was being used by students. Mice had set up a residence in one locker. A black snake was living beneath another. And someone was storing a years worth of brown bag lunches in another. We even found some undelivered Christmas presents in one. The trend being observed at other schools was also present at DA; students were not using lockers the same way they were in years past.Now some students chose to carry everything sherpa-like on their backs throughout the day, but knowing that others would still want a place to store materials, the architects looked at how the students were actually using the space on campus and saw many advisory spaces being used by students to store materials. They also noted the mini-fridges and microwaves in the classrooms, so they decided to build our new spaces to accommodate the student behavior. Form would follow function. Each new class room in the STEM/Humanities building was built with cabinets intended for student storage. They also designed space for refrigerators and microwaves. Please take some time to check out these features when you visit these new spaces at Thursdays Parents Night. Students have access to the cabinets before school, during advisory, during tutorial, during lunch and after school. The thinking is that you should never have to carry more than two classes worth of books. Concerning athletic equipment, we do encourage students to store those items in the lockers in the gym.Some advisories are not in new spaces, so we are working on making sure they have adequate storage. Bookshelves, cabinets and even minifridges are being acquired by advisors to better accommodate student needs. I personally delivered a mini-fridge on Friday to the Shores advisory, so I expect to be on the guest list for the next hot lunch. We want to make the advisory space your secure corner of campus. Much of our campus is new, so this is our year to put down roots and inhabit our spaces. All change requires an adjustment period. If things are not working out as expected, we will reassess. Good luck in the week ahead. Thursdays Club Fair is a great opportunity to try something new, to follow a passion, to meet new folks. I also look forward to sharing our campus with parents on Thursday and offering you all a peek into the lives of your children. Until thenlaugh hardrun fastbe kind!

Welcome to another Sunday edition ofYLT. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I know we are all becoming increasingly busy as we slough off our aestivation and school subtly shifts into a higher gear. Grades have begun to appear in gradebooks and summers slower pace recedes all too quickly into the rearview mirror. As we prepare to face the challenges of the year ahead, however, we must occasionally carve time out of our hectic schedules to pause and contemplate the bigger questions. Every week as I writeYLT,I ponder the values that shape the words I write and the message I intend to convey. Sunday mornings, for me, are a time of reflection and contemplation, with late Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair.While considering the week ahead, I recalled an article I read a couple of years back in the Chapel Hill News about Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Zalman Bluming of Chabad Durham-Chapel Hill visited the Lerner Jewish Community Day School in Durham to talk to young children about Rosh Hashanah, but he didnt just talk to the kids. Instead, everyone there made a shofar. The children used hack saws and drills to shape the horns, they sanded and shellacked, and they left with their own shofar. Not only did they learn about Rosh Hashanah, they participated in creating an important piece of their heritage. As Rabbi Bluming says, "By giving them a shofar, which is a small instrument, with just a little bit of training they can make a loud effective noise, a loud blast. Its the lesson that every single human being, every single child has the entire world in their hands. Literally one good deed, one good thought tips the scale toward goodness, toward kindness, toward mitzvah.As we start our week, our academic year, our new year, this is an invaluable lesson: with just a little bit of training you can make a loud effective noise. We have the world in our hands. We can tip the scales with a good thought or deed. I hope you will find your opportunity to do this in the coming weeks. We will gather as a school on Tuesday to commemorate 9/11 with a moment of silence. We will also welcome our visitors from Madrid and learn about an opportunity to visit Peru. We will have our pictures taken on Wednesday, and parents will be afforded a brief glimpse into your daily routine when they visit campus on Thursday evening to meet our amazing faculty and see our new learning spaces. We will have plenty of chances this week to tip the scales for ourselves and our community.Let us work toward goodness and kindness and mitzvahShanah tovah.As always:Laugh hardrun fastbe kind!
